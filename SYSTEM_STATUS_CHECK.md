# Unified System Status Check

**Check Time:** October 14, 2025 12:30 PM
**Status:** ✅ SYSTEM RUNNING - Waiting for first meeting

---

## System Status Summary

### ✅ System Initialization: SUCCESSFUL

**Evidence:**
1. **Session Created:** `session_20251014_162454` (Oct 14, 12:24 PM)
2. **Deployment State Initialized:** `deployment_state.json` created (Oct 14, 12:24 PM)
3. **Trajectory Directory Created:** `sessions/session_20251014_162454/trajectories/`

### ⏳ Meetings Status: WAITING

**Current State:**
- **Session ID:** 20251014_162454
- **Started:** 12:24 PM (6 minutes ago)
- **Meetings Completed:** 0 (waiting for first meeting)
- **Expected First Meeting:** Should start within configured interval

**What to Expect:**
- If interval is 120 minutes: First meeting at ~2:24 PM
- If interval is 60 minutes: First meeting at ~1:24 PM
- System is running in background thread (non-blocking)

### ✅ Deployment Manager: INITIALIZED

**Current Status (from deployment_state.json):**
```json
{
  "current_version": "v1.0",
  "stage": "shadow",
  "slo_status": {
    "compliance": false,
    "latency": false,
    "error_rate": false
  },
  "rollback_ready": false,
  "deployment_start": "2025-10-14T16:24:54"
}
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ DeploymentManager initialized correctly
- ✅ Starting at "shadow" stage (correct)
- ⚠️ SLO status all false (expected - no metrics collected yet)
- ⚠️ Rollback not ready (expected - no deployment yet)

## What's Happening Now

### Current Activity: Background Thread Running

The system is running in background thread (daemon=True), which means:
1. ✅ Colab cell returned immediately (non-blocking)
2. ✅ System is running autonomously in background
3. ⏳ First meeting will start at scheduled interval
4. ✅ You can monitor progress in separate cell

### Expected Timeline

**Minute 0 (12:24 PM):** System initialized ✅
- Session created
- Deployment state initialized
- Background threads started

**Minute 0-120:** Waiting for first meeting ⏳
- If using 120-minute interval
- System is idle, waiting for timer

**Minute 120 (~2:24 PM):** First meeting starts 🎯
- Research Director reads required files
- All 5 agents participate
- Week 1 Day 1-2 tasks discussed
- Tools executed (read_file, run_script)
- Transcript saved to reports/

**Minute 120-240:** Execution phase
- Research Director and Tech Analyst work on tasks
- Trajectory logged to session directory
- Next meeting scheduled

## How to Monitor

### Option 1: Check Reports Directory

```bash
# In Colab or terminal
!ls -lt unified-team/reports/

# Look for new files:
# - meeting_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
# - transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
```

### Option 2: Check Session Trajectories

```bash
# Check if meetings have been logged
!ls -la sessions/session_20251014_162454/trajectories/

# Look for:
# - trajectory_001.json (first meeting)
# - trajectory_002.json (second meeting)
```

### Option 3: Check Deployment State

```bash
# See if SLO status has changed
!cat unified-team/state/deployment_state.json

# Look for changes in:
# - slo_status (should change to true after experiments)
# - stage (should progress from shadow)
```

### Option 4: Live Monitoring Dashboard

```python
# In Colab monitoring cell
from pathlib import Path
import json
import time
from datetime import datetime

def monitor_system(session_id="20251014_162454", interval_seconds=30):
    """Monitor system progress in real-time"""

    reports_dir = Path('/content/cv_project/unified-team/reports')
    session_dir = Path(f'/content/cv_project/sessions/session_{session_id}')

    while True:
        print(f"\n{'='*60}")
        print(f"🕐 {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')}")
        print(f"{'='*60}")

        # Count meetings
        transcripts = list(reports_dir.glob('transcript_*.md'))
        meetings = list(reports_dir.glob('meeting_*.json'))
        trajectories = list(session_dir.glob('trajectories/*.json'))

        print(f"\n📊 Meeting Progress:")
        print(f"  Transcripts: {len(transcripts)}")
        print(f"  Meeting records: {len(meetings)}")
        print(f"  Trajectories: {len(trajectories)}")

        # Show latest meeting if exists
        if transcripts:
            latest = max(transcripts, key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)
            mtime = datetime.fromtimestamp(latest.stat().st_mtime)
            print(f"\n📝 Latest Meeting:")
            print(f"  File: {latest.name}")
            print(f"  Time: {mtime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
            print(f"  Age: {(datetime.now() - mtime).seconds // 60} minutes ago")

        # Check deployment state
        state_file = Path('/content/cv_project/unified-team/state/deployment_state.json')
        if state_file.exists():
            with open(state_file) as f:
                state = json.load(f)
            print(f"\n🚀 Deployment Status:")
            print(f"  Stage: {state['stage']}")
            print(f"  SLO Compliance: {state['slo_status']['compliance']}")
            print(f"  SLO Latency: {state['slo_status']['latency']}")
            print(f"  SLO Error Rate: {state['slo_status']['error_rate']}")

        time.sleep(interval_seconds)

# Run monitoring
monitor_system()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No meetings after 2+ hours

**Possible Causes:**
1. Meeting interval set too high (>120 minutes)
2. Background thread not started
3. Error during initialization

**Solutions:**
```python
# Check system status
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['ps', 'aux'], capture_output=True, text=True)
print("Python processes:", [line for line in result.stdout.split('\n') if 'python' in line])

# Check for errors in output
# If no background process, restart system
```

### Issue: Sessions directory empty

**Possible Causes:**
1. System hasn't started yet
2. Session creation failed

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if session directory exists
!ls -la /content/cv_project/sessions/

# If empty, system hasn't initialized
# Check Colab output for error messages
```

### Issue: Deployment state shows all false

**Status:** ✅ EXPECTED - This is normal before first meeting
- SLO status will change to true after experiments run
- Metrics will be collected during agent tool execution
- First meeting will populate these values

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)

1. **Wait for First Meeting** (Expected ~2:24 PM if 120-min interval)
   - System will automatically start meeting
   - Agents will read required files
   - Tools will be executed
   - Transcript will be saved

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Run monitoring dashboard (Option 4 above)
   - Check reports directory every 30 minutes
   - Look for transcript_*.md files

3. **Verify First Meeting Success**
   - Check `reports/transcript_*.md` for new meeting
   - Verify agents read Week 1 context
   - Confirm Research Director and Tech Analyst used tools
   - Check trajectory logged to session

### After First Meeting

4. **Review Meeting Transcript**
   - Did agents understand strategic direction?
   - Did executors begin tool development?
   - Were Week 1 Day 1-2 tasks initiated?

5. **Check Trajectory**
   - `sessions/session_20251014_162454/trajectories/trajectory_001.json`
   - Complete meeting data preserved

6. **Verify Auto-Sync**
   - Check if files appeared in Drive backup
   - Verify crash recovery capability

### If No Meeting After 3 Hours

7. **Manual Intervention**
   ```python
   # Force a meeting manually
   topic = open('unified-team/WEEK_1_MEETING_TOPIC.md').read()
   result = coordinator.run_meeting(topic)
   print(f"Meeting completed: {result['success']}")
   ```
