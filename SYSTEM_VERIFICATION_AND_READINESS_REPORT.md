## Part 8: Critical Gap Identification

### Gap 1: Universal Diagnostic Engine (URGENT)

**What's Missing:**
- Adapters for external models (CLIP, ALIGN, Flamingo)
- Unified interface for attention extraction
- Standardized metrics across architectures

**Why It's Critical:**
- Week 1 Discovery Phase depends on cross-architecture testing
- Go/No-Go decision on Day 7 requires testing ≥2 external models
- This is THE core deliverable for CVPR paper

**Who Should Implement:**
- Research Director (during next meeting)
- Tech Analyst (parallel support)

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-2: Design and initial implementation
- Days 3-5: Testing and refinement
- Days 6-7: Statistical validation

**Status in Current System:**
- ✅ Framework exists: `attention_analysis.py` for V2
- ⚠️ Needs generalization for external models
- ❌ Adapters don't exist yet

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT IMPLEMENT NOW**
- This is a research task, not a system feature
- Agents should implement this during autonomous meetings
- System provides the TOOLS (`run_script()`, `read_file()`, `list_files()`)
- Agents use tools to CREATE the diagnostic engine

### Gap 2: External Model Environments (URGENT)

**What's Missing:**
- CLIP model installation and test scripts
- ALIGN model access (if available)
- Common dataset preparation (COCO captions)

**Why It's Critical:**
- Can't test cross-architecture without external models
- Week 1 Days 3-5 depend on this

**Who Should Implement:**
- Tech Analyst (during next meeting)

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Environment setup
- Day 2: Validation and baseline extraction

**Status:**
- ❌ Not set up yet (expected)
- ⚪ GPU access available in Colab

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT IMPLEMENT NOW**
- This is a setup task for agents to do
- Tech Analyst should use `run_script()` to install and test

### Gap 3: Literature Review / Web Search (LOW PRIORITY)

**What's Missing:**
- Web search tool for literature review
- Mentioned by Critic in transcript (line 823)

**Why It's Low Priority:**
- Agents have extensive research context already
- Literature review can be manual between meetings
- Not blocking for Week 1 execution

**Recommendation:** **SKIP FOR NOW**
- Can add later if agents explicitly request it
- Not critical for next meeting
