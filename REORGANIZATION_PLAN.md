# Project Reorganization Plan
## 📊 Current Status Analysis

### ✅ Production Pipeline (Stable & Deployed)
- **Main Pipeline**: `pipeline.py` - Complete 3-stage system
- **Status**: V1.0 successfully deployed with +14.2% improvement
- **Performance**: 0.059ms P95 latency, 113 QPS throughput
- **Core Value**: Already achieving business objectives

### 🔬 Research Pipeline (Experimental)
- **Research Directory**: Contains extensive experimental work
- **Key Findings**: Current data is already perfect (nDCG=1.0)
- **Status**: Multiple optimization attempts showed NO improvement
- **Conclusion**: Further CV optimization not worthwhile with current data

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendation: Focus on Production Pipeline

### Why Continue with Original Pipeline?
1. **Proven Success**: V1.0 delivered measurable business impact
2. **Data Quality**: Current dataset is already optimally sorted
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Research showed diminishing returns
4. **Production Ready**: Stable system with monitoring

## 📁 Proposed File Organization

### Keep in Root (Production Focus):
```
/computer-vision/
├── pipeline.py                 # Main production pipeline
├── config/
│   ├── default.json           # Production config
│   └── advanced.json          # Extended options
├── scripts/                   # Core production scripts
├── data/                      # Production datasets
├── requirements.txt           # Core dependencies
└── README.md                  # Main documentation
```

### Archive Research Work:
```
/computer-vision/
├── archive/
│   ├── research_2024/         # Move current research/ here
│   ├── colab_experiments/     # Colab night runner system
│   ├── statistical_analysis/ # Bootstrap CI, etc.
│   └── exploration_reports/   # All analysis documents
```

### Clean Production Structure:
```
/computer-vision/
├── src/                       # Core modules
│   ├── subject_object.py
│   ├── conflict_penalty.py
│   └── dual_score.py
├── models/                    # Trained models
├── tests/                     # Production tests
└── docs/                      # Production documentation
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Archive Research**: Move experimental work to `archive/`
2. **Consolidate Scripts**: Keep only production-critical scripts
3. **Update Documentation**: Focus on production pipeline usage
4. **Clean Dependencies**: Remove research-only packages

### Production Focus:
1. **Monitor V1.0**: Track performance metrics
2. **Incremental Improvements**: Small, proven enhancements
3. **Scale Horizontally**: Optimize infrastructure, not algorithms
4. **Data Pipeline**: Focus on data quality and collection

## 💡 Key Insight
Your research validated that the **original pipeline is already optimal** for current data. 
The best ROI comes from:
- Production stability
- Data quality improvements  
- Infrastructure scaling
- Monitoring and alerting

## Decision Point
**Recommendation**: Proceed with production pipeline as primary focus
- Archive research work for future reference
- Maintain clean, focused codebase
- Optimize for operational excellence
