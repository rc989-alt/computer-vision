## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Issue 1: Action Parsing Quality (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Actions extracted are sentence fragments, not complete tasks.

**Evidence from `actions_20251014_021500.json`:**

❌ **Bad Actions:**
```json
{
  "description": "visual attention recovery",
  "agent": "research_director",
  "priority": "medium"
}
{
  "description": "from team members",
  "agent": "research_director",
  "priority": "medium"
}
{
  "description": "and course correction if needed",
  "agent": "research_director",
  "priority": "medium"
}
{
  "description": "gradient magnitudes per modality",
  "agent": "pre_architect",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

✅ **Should Be:**
```json
{
  "description": "Run baseline attention analysis on V2 model to diagnose attention collapse",
  "agent": "research_director",
  "priority": "high"
}
{
  "description": "Implement gradient magnitude tracking per modality in training loop",
  "agent": "pre_architect",
  "priority": "high"
}
{
  "description": "Create daily standup feedback mechanism for team members",
  "agent": "research_director",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

**Root Cause:**
`multi-agent/tools/parse_actions.py` - Regex patterns capture partial matches:

```python
action_patterns = {
    'experiment': r'(?:test|experiment|try|validate|measure)\s+([^.!?\n]+)',
    # This captures everything AFTER the verb until punctuation
    # But agents write: "Run **baseline attention analysis** on V2"
    # Parser captures: "baseline attention analysis on V2"
    # But sometimes it captures mid-sentence fragments
}
```

**Impact:**
- Executive team receives unclear instructions
- Actions are too vague to execute
- Human review cannot understand what needs to be done

---

### Issue 2: Executive Team Context Mismatch (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Executive team executing **V1 deployment tools** instead of **V2 research tasks**.

**Evidence from `execution_20251014_022410.json`:**

```
Running: python3 /content/cv_project/research/evaluate_model.py
  --model=research/v1_production.pth  ← V1, not V2!
  --dataset=data/validation_set

Deploying model to shadow stage...
  Target: deployment/shadow/model.pth  ← Deployment, not research!
```

**What Should Have Happened:**
```bash
# Research actions aligned with planning consensus:
python research/02_v2_research_line/attention_analysis.py \
  --model=research/multimodal_v2_production.pth \
  --output=analysis/attention_collapse_diagnosis.json

python research/02_v2_research_line/train_modality_balanced.py \
  --epochs=20 \
  --loss=modality_balanced \
  --output=runs/sprint_1/

python research/tools/gradient_magnitude_tracker.py \
  --model=research/multimodal_v2_production.pth \
  --track_per_modality=True
```

**Root Cause:**
Executive agents are responding to actions based on their **deployment-focused prompts** and **hardcoded tool patterns**, not the **CVPR research context** from planning.

**Current Tool Patterns** (`executive_coordinator.py` lines 490-541):
```python
# Only matches deployment patterns
if "deploy_model" in response.lower() and "shadow" in response.lower():
    execute_shadow_deployment()
if "evaluation" in response.lower() or "run_evaluation" in response.lower():
    execute_evaluation()  # But on V1 model!
```

**Missing:** Research-specific tool patterns:
- Attention analysis
- Gradient magnitude tracking
- Loss function experiments
- Statistical validation

---

### Issue 3: Consensus Score Calculation (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Consensus score shows 0.19 (very low) despite unanimous agreement.

**Evidence:**
- Summary: `Consensus score: 0.19`
- Transcript: All agents agreed on Option A
- Research Director: "unanimous team consensus"
- Data Analyst: "99.5% confidence interval in decision"

**Root Cause:** Unknown - need to inspect consensus calculation logic.

**Impact:** Low - score is misleading but doesn't affect execution.

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Action Parsing (CRITICAL)

**File:** `multi-agent/tools/parse_actions.py`

**Current Problem:**
```python
# Captures fragments starting from trigger word
'experiment': r'(?:test|experiment|try|validate|measure)\s+([^.!?\n]+)'
```

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Context Window Extraction**
```python
def extract_action_with_context(text, match_pos, window=100):
    """Extract full sentence around matched keyword"""
    # Find sentence boundaries (. ! ? or newline)
    start = max(0, match_pos - window)
    end = min(len(text), match_pos + window)

    # Expand to full sentence
    while start > 0 and text[start] not in '.!?\n':
        start -= 1
    while end < len(text) and text[end] not in '.!?\n':
        end += 1

    return text[start:end].strip()
```

**Option B: Look for Action Markers**

Agents often use markdown/formatting for actions:
- "**Action:** Run baseline analysis"
- "1. Implement gradient tracking"
- "- Test modality balance"

Parse these structured formats first before falling back to regex.

**Option C: Use LLM for Action Extraction**

Most reliable but adds latency:
```python
def extract_actions_with_llm(agent_response):
    prompt = f"""
    Extract concrete action items from this agent response.
    Return as JSON list with: description, priority, assignee

    Agent Response:
    {agent_response}
    """
    # Call Claude/GPT to extract actions
```

**Recommendation:** **Implement Option B + Option A** (structured + context window)

---

### Priority 2: Add Research Tool Execution (CRITICAL)

**File:** `executive_coordinator.py` lines 490-541

**Current tool patterns are deployment-focused. Add research patterns:**

```python
# === RESEARCH EXECUTION PATTERNS (NEW) ===

# Pattern 1: Attention Analysis
if any(keyword in response.lower() for keyword in
       ["attention analysis", "attention collapse", "visual contribution"]):
    self._log("   🔬 Executing: Attention Analysis")
    result = self._execute_tool(
        "python",
        "research/02_v2_research_line/attention_analysis.py",
        args=[
            "--model=research/multimodal_v2_production.pth",
            f"--output=analysis/attention_{timestamp}.json"
        ]
    )

# Pattern 2: Gradient Magnitude Tracking
if any(keyword in response.lower() for keyword in
       ["gradient magnitude", "track gradients", "modality contribution"]):
    self._log("   📊 Executing: Gradient Magnitude Tracking")
    result = self._execute_tool(
        "python",
        "research/tools/gradient_magnitude_tracker.py",
        args=[
            "--model=research/multimodal_v2_production.pth",
            "--track_per_modality=True",
            f"--output=analysis/gradients_{timestamp}.json"
        ]
    )

# Pattern 3: Training Sprint (20 epochs)
if any(keyword in response.lower() for keyword in
       ["train", "training sprint", "20 epochs", "experiment"]):
    # Parse training parameters from response
    loss_type = "modality_balanced" if "balanced" in response.lower() else "standard"

    self._log(f"   🚀 Executing: Training Sprint ({loss_type} loss)")
    result = self._execute_tool(
        "python",
        "research/02_v2_research_line/train_v2.py",
        args=[
            f"--loss={loss_type}",
            "--epochs=20",
            f"--output=runs/sprint_{timestamp}/",
            "--mlflow_tracking=True"
        ]
    )

# Pattern 4: Statistical Validation
if any(keyword in response.lower() for keyword in
       ["statistical", "significance", "p-value", "bootstrap"]):
    self._log("   📈 Executing: Statistical Validation")
    result = self._execute_tool(
        "python",
        "research/tools/statistical_validation.py",
        args=[
            "--experiment_dir=runs/",
            "--confidence=0.95",
            f"--output=analysis/stats_{timestamp}.json"
        ]
    )

# Pattern 5: Literature Search
if any(keyword in response.lower() for keyword in
       ["search papers", "cvpr", "literature", "survey"]):
    self._log("   📚 Executing: Literature Search")
    # Note: This would require API access to arXiv or similar
    # For now, log the request for human follow-up
    self._log("   ⚠️  Literature search requires manual execution")
    self._log(f"   📝 Search query: {response[:200]}")
```

**Also need to create missing research scripts:**

1. `research/tools/gradient_magnitude_tracker.py` - Track per-modality gradients
2. `research/tools/statistical_validation.py` - Bootstrap confidence intervals
3. `research/02_v2_research_line/train_v2.py` - Training script with modality-balanced loss

---

### Priority 3: Executive Agent Context Injection (MEDIUM)

**Problem:** Executive agents don't know the meeting context (CVPR focus, Option A chosen).

**Solution:** Pass planning meeting summary to executive agents.

**File:** `executive_coordinator.py` lines 529-547

**Current:**
```python
context = f"""
Action: {action_text}
Priority: {priority}
Assigned Owner: {agent_name}

Provide your execution plan. If you need to use tools, specify them clearly.
"""
```

**Enhanced:**
```python
context = f"""
CONTEXT: CVPR 2025 Paper Submission - "When Vision Goes Blind"
Team Consensus: Diagnose and fix attention collapse in V2 multimodal fusion model
Current Issue: V2 model shows 0.15% visual contribution (attention collapse)
Research Goals: Identify root cause, implement fix, validate improvement
Timeline: 24 days to abstract, 31 days to full paper

Action: {action_text}
Priority: {priority}
Assigned Owner: {agent_name}
Planning Meeting Summary: {self._get_last_meeting_summary()}

Provide your execution plan focused on RESEARCH (not deployment).
If you need to use tools, specify:
- Research scripts (attention_analysis.py, train_v2.py, etc.)
- Experiments to run (20-epoch sprints)
- Analysis to perform (gradient tracking, statistical validation)
"""
```

---

### Priority 4: Fix Consensus Score (LOW)

**Investigation needed:**
Check `multi-agent/agents/meeting.py` or wherever consensus is calculated.

**Expected:** If all agents agree on same option → score should be 0.80-1.0
**Actual:** Score is 0.19

**Possible causes:**
- Comparing full text similarity (verbose responses appear dissimilar)
- Looking for exact keyword matches (different phrasing = low score)
- Inverted scoring (0.19 = 81% consensus?)
