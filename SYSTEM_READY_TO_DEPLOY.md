## 🔧 What Each Team Does

### Planning Team (Every 30 minutes)

**Reads:**
- Research summaries (`research/RESEARCH_CONTEXT.md`)
- V1/V2 status (`research/01_v1_production_line/SUMMARY.md`)
- Previous execution results (`multi-agent/reports/execution/*.json`)
- Current metrics (`runs/report/metrics.json`)

**Creates:**
- Meeting summary (`multi-agent/reports/planning/summary_*.md`)
- Action list (`multi-agent/reports/planning/actions_*.json`)
- Handoff file (`multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json`)

### Executive Team (Every 5 minutes)

**Reads:**
- Pending actions (`multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json`)

**Executes (REAL operations):**
- `run_python_script()` - Actually runs Python scripts
- `deploy_model()` - Actually copies model files
- `run_evaluation()` - Actually evaluates models on data
- `collect_metrics()` - Actually reads metrics from JSON
- `run_bash_command()` - Actually runs bash commands

**Creates:**
- Execution reports (`multi-agent/reports/execution/execution_*.json`)
- Tool logs with results
- Deployment artifacts

📊 Found 18 pending actions

🎯 Executing top 3 actions:

1. [ops_commander] Evaluate V1 on validation set
   🔧 TOOL: run_evaluation(research/evaluate_model.py, research/v1_production.pth, data/validation_set)
   ✅ SUCCESS: NDCG@10 = 0.7234, Latency = 45.2ms

2. [infra_guardian] Check system health
   🔧 TOOL: collect_metrics(runs/report/metrics.json)
   ✅ SUCCESS: All SLOs passed

3. [compliance_monitor] Verify SLO compliance
   🔧 TOOL: run_python_script(research/check_slo_compliance.py)
   ✅ SUCCESS: 100% compliance

💾 Saved execution report: execution_20251013_140500.json

## 🎯 Known Limitations & Safeguards

### What Executive Team CAN Do:
- ✅ Run Python scripts with real data
- ✅ Deploy models to staged environments (shadow, 5%, 20%)
- ✅ Evaluate models and collect metrics
- ✅ Run bash commands
- ✅ Read/write configuration files

### What Executive Team CANNOT Do:
- ❌ Modify core system code without approval
- ❌ Deploy directly to production (requires staged rollout)
- ❌ Access files outside allowed directories
- ❌ Skip safety checks and validations
- ❌ Bypass rollback procedures

### Safety Features:
- 🔒 File access control via FileBridge (read-only for most agents)
- 🔒 All tool executions logged with timestamps
- 🔒 Execution reports saved for audit trail
- 🔒 Rollback procedures built-in
- 🔒 SLO compliance checks before deployment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Import Still Fails:

**Check sync:**
```python
!cat /content/cv_project/SYNC_REPORT.json
```
Should show 43 files synced.

**Check file exists:**
```python
!ls -la /content/cv_project/multi-agent/run_meeting.py
```
Should show the file (29 KB).

**Test import manually:**
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/content/cv_project/multi-agent")
from run_meeting import MeetingOrchestrator
print("✅ Import works!")
```

### If Meeting Doesn't Start:

Check the log:
```python
!tail -50 /content/executive.log
```

Look for:
- API key issues
- File permission errors
- Agent initialization failures
