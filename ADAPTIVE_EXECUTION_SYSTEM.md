# Adaptive Execution System - Complete Guide

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY ADAPTIVE - Tasks change based on meeting results

---

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Your Concern:**
> "Tech Analyst MUST use ‚â•2 tools (run_script for GPU check, CLIP install) i am not sure if it would be CLIP install everytime. and the execution should do all the pirority tasks listed in the meeting in order"

**Solution:**
‚úÖ Tasks are now **dynamically generated** from previous meeting's action items
‚úÖ Execution follows **priority order** (HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW)
‚úÖ No hardcoded tasks - everything adapts to what was decided

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### Meeting Flow:

```
Meeting N (Planning):
‚îú‚îÄ Agents discuss strategy
‚îú‚îÄ Make decisions
‚îú‚îÄ Assign tasks with priorities
‚îî‚îÄ Save to actions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
     ‚îÇ
     ‚îÇ [Automatic generation]
     ‚Üì
Meeting N+1 Topic Auto-Generated:
‚îú‚îÄ Read previous meeting files
‚îú‚îÄ Extract tasks from actions.json
‚îú‚îÄ Group by agent and priority
‚îú‚îÄ Create NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md
     ‚îÇ
     ‚îÇ [Meeting N+1 starts]
     ‚Üì
Meeting N+1 (Execution):
‚îú‚îÄ Executors read previous meeting
‚îú‚îÄ See THEIR specific tasks
‚îú‚îÄ Execute in priority order (HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW)
‚îú‚îÄ Use appropriate tools
‚îú‚îÄ Save results
‚îî‚îÄ Create NEW actions.json
     ‚îÇ
     ‚îÇ [Automatic generation]
     ‚Üì
Meeting N+2 Topic Auto-Generated:
‚îî‚îÄ Repeat with NEW tasks...
```

## üìä Example: How Tasks Adapt

### Scenario 1: After Strategic Planning Meeting

**Meeting N decisions:**
- Decided: Focus on V1 success story (Option C)
- Research Director assigned: Document V1's MMR methodology (HIGH priority)
- Tech Analyst assigned: Extract V1 metrics (HIGH priority)

**Meeting N+1 auto-generated topic:**
```markdown
### Research Director - 1 task assigned

#### HIGH Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 1:** Document V1's MMR methodology
- Type: analysis
- Priority: HIGH
- Suggested tools: read_file(), list_files()
- Action required: Read V1 code, create documentation

### Tech Analyst - 1 task assigned

#### HIGH Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 1:** Extract V1 metrics from comprehensive_evaluation.json
- Type: analysis
- Priority: HIGH
- Suggested tools: read_file(), run_script()
- Action required: Load JSON, extract metrics, analyze
```

**Meeting N+1 execution:**
- Research Director uses `read_file('research/v1_model.py')`
- Research Director creates `V1_MMR_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Tech Analyst uses `read_file('comprehensive_evaluation.json')`
- Tech Analyst creates `v1_metrics_analysis.py`

### Scenario 2: After Go/No-Go Decision

**Meeting N decisions:**
- Decided: Proceed with Plan A (attention collapse framework)
- Research Director assigned: Test diagnostic tool on CLIP (HIGH priority)
- Tech Analyst assigned: Install CLIP model (HIGH priority), prepare dataset (MEDIUM)

**Meeting N+1 auto-generated topic:**
```markdown
### Research Director - 1 task assigned

#### HIGH Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 1:** Test diagnostic tool on CLIP model
- Type: experiment
- Priority: HIGH
- Suggested tools: run_script()
- Action required: Run diagnostic, analyze results

### Tech Analyst - 2 tasks assigned

#### HIGH Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 1:** Install CLIP model and dependencies
- Type: setup
- Priority: HIGH
- Suggested tools: run_script()
- Action required: Install transformers, load CLIP

#### MEDIUM Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 2:** Prepare COCO dataset (n=100 samples)
- Type: setup
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Suggested tools: run_script()
- Action required: Download, preprocess dataset
```

**Meeting N+1 execution:**
- Tech Analyst executes HIGH priority first: `run_script('pip install transformers')`
- Research Director waits for CLIP to be ready
- Tech Analyst completes CLIP setup, moves to MEDIUM: dataset prep
- Research Director then runs: `run_script('test_diagnostic_clip.py')`

### Scenario 3: After Experiment Results

**Meeting N decisions:**
- Decided: CLIP results promising, expand to ALIGN
- Research Director assigned: Implement ALIGN adapter (HIGH priority)
- Tech Analyst assigned: Run ALIGN experiments (MEDIUM priority)
- Pre-Architect assigned: Review architecture (LOW priority)

**Meeting N+1 auto-generated topic:**
```markdown
### Research Director - 1 task assigned

#### HIGH Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 1:** Implement ALIGN adapter for diagnostic tool
- Type: implementation
- Priority: HIGH
- Suggested tools: read_file(), run_script()
- Action required: Study ALIGN, create adapter, test

### Tech Analyst - 1 task assigned

#### MEDIUM Priority Tasks (1):
**Task 1:** Run experiments on ALIGN with n=100 samples
- Type: experiment
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Suggested tools: run_script()
- Action required: Test ALIGN, collect results
```

**Meeting N+1 execution:**
- Research Director executes HIGH: implements ALIGN adapter
- Tech Analyst executes MEDIUM: runs experiments once adapter ready
- Pre-Architect reviews (no tools needed, LOW priority)

## ü§ñ Automatic Topic Generation

### Script: `generate_next_meeting_topic.py`

**Location:** `unified-team/generate_next_meeting_topic.py`

**What it does:**
1. Reads latest `actions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
2. Groups tasks by agent and priority
3. Determines appropriate tools based on task type
4. Generates `NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md`

**Usage:**
```bash
cd unified-team
python3 generate_next_meeting_topic.py
```

**Output:**
```
======================================================================
ü§ñ GENERATING NEXT MEETING TOPIC
======================================================================

üìÇ Loaded: actions_20251014_033652.json
   Total actions: 21

üìä Task Distribution:
   research_director: 5 total (H:0, M:5, L:0)
   tech_analyst: 0 total (H:0, M:0, L:0)
   pre_architect: 5 total (H:0, M:5, L:0)

‚úÖ Generated: unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md

üí° Use this topic for your next meeting:
   coordinator.run_meeting(open('unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md').read())
======================================================================
```

### Automation Options

**Option 1: Post-Meeting Hook**
Add to coordinator after each meeting:
```python
# After meeting completes
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['python3', 'unified-team/generate_next_meeting_topic.py'])

# Next meeting uses generated topic
next_topic = open('unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md').read()
coordinator.run_meeting(next_topic)
```

**Option 2: Manual Between Meetings**
Run script manually after reviewing meeting results:
```bash
# Review latest meeting
cat unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md | tail -100

# Generate next topic
python3 unified-team/generate_next_meeting_topic.py

# Review generated topic
cat unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md

# Run meeting with generated topic (if satisfied)
# In Python/Colab:
# coordinator.run_meeting(open('unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md').read())
```

**Option 3: Integrated Into Autonomous System**
Modify `unified_autonomous_system.ipynb` to auto-generate:
```python
# In meeting loop, after each meeting:
for meeting_num in range(max_meetings):
    if meeting_num == 0:
        # First meeting uses strategic planning topic
        topic = STRATEGIC_PLANNING_TOPIC
    else:
        # Subsequent meetings use auto-generated topics
        subprocess.run(['python3', 'unified-team/generate_next_meeting_topic.py'])
        topic = open('unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md').read()

    result = coordinator.run_meeting(topic)
```

## üìã Priority-Based Execution

### How Priority Works:

**HIGH Priority:**
- Must be completed or explicitly blocked
- Executed first before any other tasks
- Blockers reported immediately
- If blocked, noted and moved to next HIGH task

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Attempted after all HIGH tasks
- Can be deferred if time limited
- Should aim for ‚â•50% completion

**LOW Priority:**
- Attempted only if time permits
- Can be postponed to next meeting
- No penalty for not completing

### Example Execution Order:

**Tasks assigned:**
1. Research Director: Task A (HIGH), Task B (MEDIUM), Task C (LOW)
2. Tech Analyst: Task D (HIGH), Task E (MEDIUM)

**Execution sequence:**
```
1. Research Director starts Task A (HIGH)
2. Tech Analyst starts Task D (HIGH)
3. Research Director completes A ‚Üí starts Task B (MEDIUM)
4. Tech Analyst completes D ‚Üí starts Task E (MEDIUM)
5. Research Director completes B ‚Üí starts Task C (LOW) if time permits
6. Tech Analyst completes E ‚Üí supports Research Director
```

**Status report:**
```markdown
## Research Director
- Task A (HIGH): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Task B (MEDIUM): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Task C (LOW): ‚è≥ DEFERRED (time limited)

## Tech Analyst
- Task D (HIGH): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Task E (MEDIUM): ‚úÖ COMPLETE
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Recommendations

The script automatically suggests tools based on:

**Task Type:**
- `experiment` ‚Üí `run_script()`
- `analysis` ‚Üí `read_file()`
- `setup` ‚Üí `run_script()`
- `implementation` ‚Üí `read_file()`, `run_script()`
- `review` ‚Üí `read_file()`

**Description Keywords:**
- "read", "review", "analyze" ‚Üí `read_file()`
- "run", "test", "execute" ‚Üí `run_script()`
- "find", "locate", "search" ‚Üí `list_files()`

**Example:**
```markdown
**Task:** Test diagnostic tool on CLIP model
- Type: experiment
- Suggested tools: run_script()
- Action: Run test_diagnostic_clip.py, collect results
```

Executors can adapt suggestions based on actual needs.

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

**After meeting, verify execution:**

1. **Check tools used:**
   ```bash
   grep "Tools Executed:" unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md | tail -1
   # Expected: Tools Executed: ‚â•4 (if both executors had tasks)
   ```

2. **Verify priority order:**
   ```bash
   # Check that HIGH priority tasks mentioned before MEDIUM/LOW
   grep -A 5 "Task.*HIGH" unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md
   ```

3. **Check task completion:**
   ```bash
   # Look for status reports in transcript
   grep -A 3 "Status:" unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md
   ```

## üéØ Key Advantages

### vs. Hardcoded Tasks:

**Hardcoded (OLD):**
```markdown
Tech Analyst MUST:
- Install CLIP
- Check GPU
- Download dataset
```
‚ùå Same tasks every meeting
‚ùå Not responsive to decisions
‚ùå Wastes time if already done

**Adaptive (NEW):**
```markdown
Tech Analyst tasks from previous meeting:
- HIGH: [whatever was decided]
- MEDIUM: [whatever was assigned]
```
‚úÖ Tasks change based on decisions
‚úÖ Responsive to meeting results
‚úÖ No duplicate work

### Benefits:

1. **Responsive:** Tasks adapt to decisions made
2. **Priority-driven:** Important work happens first
3. **No waste:** Don't repeat completed work
4. **Flexible:** Handles changing requirements
5. **Traceable:** Clear link from decision ‚Üí task ‚Üí execution
