## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Files Not Found**
```bash
# Solution: Re-run sync script
exec(open('/content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/research/colab/sync_all_files.py').read())
```

**Issue: Planning Meeting Hangs**
- Wait 5 minutes (API rate limit)
- Check logs: `!tail -100 /content/executive.log`
- System will retry automatically

**Issue: Tools Not Executing**
```python
# Verify handoff file exists
!cat /content/cv_project/multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json

# Check Executive Team initialization
!grep "Executive Team" /content/executive.log
```

**Issue: Colab Disconnected**
- All data saved to Drive (auto-sync every 10s)
- Check trajectory log for complete history
- Re-run deployment script to resume
