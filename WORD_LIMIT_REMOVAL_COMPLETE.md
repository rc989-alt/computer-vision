# Word Limit Removal - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ✅ ALL WORD LIMITS REMOVED

---

## Summary

Removed all word limit restrictions from agent prompts to allow full, untruncated responses.

### **Files Updated:**

#### Planning Team (4 files) - ✅ Previously completed
- `01_strategic_leader.md` - 3 limits removed
- `02_empirical_validation_lead.md` - 2 limits removed
- `03_critical_evaluator_openai.md` - 3 limits removed
- `04_gemini_research_advisor.md` - 1 limit removed

#### Executive Team (3 files) - ✅ Just completed
- `01_quality_safety_officer.md` - 1 limit removed
  - Changed: `### QUALITY & SAFETY SUMMARY (≤ 250 words)` → `### QUALITY & SAFETY SUMMARY`

- `02_ops_commander.md` - 1 limit removed
  - Changed: `### DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY (≤ 200 words)` → `### DEPLOYMENT SUMMARY`

- `03_infrastructure_performance_monitor.md` - 1 limit removed
  - Changed: `### INFRASTRUCTURE & PERFORMANCE SUMMARY (≤ 250 words)` → `### INFRASTRUCTURE & PERFORMANCE SUMMARY`

## Technical Thresholds Preserved

The following "≤" symbols were **NOT removed** because they are technical requirements, not word limits:

- RTO ≤ 10 min (Recovery Time Objective)
- RPO ≤ 5 min (Recovery Point Objective)
- P95 Latency < 500ms (+≤5ms drift)
- Checkpoint age ≤ 24h

These are system performance targets and should remain.

## Impact

### **Before:**
- Agents limited to 120-300 words per section
- Responses truncated at arbitrary word counts
- Incomplete analysis and reasoning

### **After:**
- Agents provide complete, detailed responses
- Full visibility into reasoning and evidence
- Comprehensive analysis without artificial limits

### **This is critical for:**
- Reviewing detailed execution results from multi-task cycles
- Understanding complex statistical findings
- Full evidence verification in Phase 5.5
- Complete integrity violation reports
- Comprehensive research recommendations
- Detailed MLflow run analysis

## Verification

All active agent prompts are now word-limit-free:

```bash
# Check Planning Team (should return nothing)
grep "≤.*words" multi-agent/agents/prompts/planning_team/*.md
# Result: No matches ✅

# Check Executive Team (should only show technical thresholds)
grep "≤.*words" multi-agent/agents/prompts/executive_team/*.md
# Result: No matches ✅
```

## System Status

✅ **Planning Team** - Fully unrestricted (completed earlier)
✅ **Executive Team** - Fully unrestricted (completed now)
✅ **Notebook** - Ready to run with all fixes applied
✅ **Enforcement System** - All features preserved
✅ **Timestamp System** - Working correctly

**Next:** Run `cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb` in Colab for Cycle 1 execution with full agent responses!
