## üöÄ To Resume Your Meeting (One Command)

```bash
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent
python3 run_strategic_analysis.py
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Use your existing FILE_ACCESS_SYSTEM
- ‚úÖ Load all research data from `research/` directories
- ‚úÖ Run 9 AI agents (Pre-Architect, V1 Team, V2 Team, CoTRR, Tech Analysis, Critic, Integrity, Data Analyst, Moderator)
- ‚úÖ Analyze mistakes and data integrity issues
- ‚úÖ Generate new pipeline and strategic recommendations
- ‚úÖ Create prioritized action items
- ‚úÖ Save comprehensive reports in `multi-agent/reports/`

**Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Output**: Transcript, summary, prioritized actions, integrity analysis

## üìä Key Data Points Agents Will Analyze

### V2 Research Line Issues (from your files):

**1. Visual Features Not Working** ‚ùå
- Masking visual features: Only 0.15% performance drop
- **Problem**: Visual modality not contributing to multimodal fusion
- **Source**: `research/02_v2_research_line/v2_scientific_review_report.json#feature_ablation`

**2. High V1/V2 Correlation** ‚ùå
- Correlation: 0.9908 (99%+)
- **Problem**: V2 might just be linear transformation of V1
- **Source**: `research/02_v2_research_line/v2_scientific_review_report.json#score_verification`

**3. Threshold Failures** ‚ùå
- Compliance: 13.82% (need 15%)
- NDCG: 1.14% (need 8%)
- Low margin: 0.98 (need <0.1)
- **Source**: `research/02_v2_research_line/production_evaluation.json`

**4. But Statistical Significance!** ‚úÖ
- nDCG improvement: +0.011 (CI95: [+0.0101, +0.0119])
- p-value: <0.001
- **Decision**: PAUSE_AND_FIX (not discard)

## üìÅ Files Agents Can Access (via FILE_ACCESS_SYSTEM)

Your existing system gives agents read access to:
- `research/01_v1_production_line/` - V1 success story
- `research/02_v2_research_line/` - V2 experiments and reviews
- `research/03_cotrr_lightweight_line/` - 21 optimization approaches
- `research/04_final_analysis/` - Statistical analysis
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `data/` - Datasets

**Critical Files**:
- `research/02_v2_research_line/production_evaluation.json`
- `research/02_v2_research_line/v2_scientific_review_report.json`
- `research/02_v2_research_line/V2_Rescue_Plan_Executive_Summary.md`

## üéØ What Meeting Will Deliver

### 1. Comprehensive Diagnosis
- Why V2's multimodal fusion failed
- Root cause of visual feature issues
- Explanation of high correlation problem

### 2. Strategic Recommendations
- **SHORT-TERM** (2-4 weeks): Fix V2 vs Pivot decision
- **MEDIUM-TERM** (1-3 months): New architecture + pipeline
- **LONG-TERM** (3-6 months): Full multimodal system

### 3. Prioritized Actions
- **HIGH**: Immediate actions (24-48h)
- **MEDIUM**: Foundation building (1-2 weeks)
- **LOW**: Long-term improvements

### 4. Decision Framework
Clear criteria for resource allocation and go/no-go thresholds

## üí° Key Questions Meeting Will Answer

1. **Should we fix V2 or start fresh?**
   - Pro-fix: Statistical significance is real
   - Pro-pivot: Integrity issues suggest fundamental problems

2. **What's the root cause of V2 issues?**
   - Architecture (late fusion vs cross-attention)?
   - Training (text dominating gradients)?
   - Evaluation (metrics not sensitive enough)?

3. **What's highest ROI next step?**
   - V1 incremental optimization (safe)
   - V2 architecture fixes (risky)
   - New candidate generation (different problem)
   - Data quality improvements (foundational)

4. **How to prevent this in future?**
   - Better evaluation frameworks
   - Earlier integrity checks
   - More rigorous ablation studies

---

## üé≠ Expected Agent Debate

**V1 Team**: *"V1 works! Let's optimize what we have."*

**V2 Team**: *"Integrity issues are real, but statistical signal is significant. We can fix this architecturally."*

**Critic**: *"0.99 correlation with V1 suggests you're not doing real multimodal fusion. Start fresh."*

**Tech Analysis**: *"Visual feature ablation points to insufficient fusion. Need cross-modal attention, not concatenation."*

**Integrity Guardian**: *"All claims must be backed by data. The scientific review clearly shows failed checks."*

**Moderator**: *"Consensus on V1 success. Question: Fix V2 or pivot? Need decision framework."*
