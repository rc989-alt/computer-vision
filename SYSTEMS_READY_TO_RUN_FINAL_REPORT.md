**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ **BOTH SYSTEMS READY TO DEPLOY**
**Google Drive Sync:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Documentation:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Both autonomous multi-agent systems have been verified, synced to Google Drive, and are ready to run:

1. **Old System (Two-Tier)** - Production deployment focus with priority-based execution
2. **Unified System (Single-Team)** - Research execution focus with full transcript context

All recent updates including priority-based execution documentation and handoff mechanisms have been synced to Google Drive.

## System 1: Old Two-Tier System (Production Deployment)

### Purpose
Progressive V1.0 model deployment through shadow ‚Üí 5% ‚Üí 20% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% with autonomous monitoring and rollback capability.

### Architecture
```
Planning Team (6 agents) - Strategic decisions every 30 min
   ‚Üì (handoff via pending_actions.json)

### How to Launch

```bash
# Navigate to multi-agent directory in Google Drive
cd "/Users/guyan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-rc989@cornell.edu/ÊàëÁöÑ‰∫ëÁ´ØÁ°¨Áõò/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/multi-agent"

# Run coordinator
python3 autonomous_coordinator.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Autonomous Coordinator initialized
   Project root: .../computer-vision-clean
   Agents: 12 (6 planning + 6 executive)
   Channels: 8

üíì Heartbeat system started
‚úÖ AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM ACTIVE

üí° System running in background...
üí° Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### First Cycle (60 minutes)

**Minutes 0-30: Planning Meeting**
- Planning Team discusses strategy
- Creates 15-20 action items with priorities
- Writes `reports/handoff/pending_actions.json`

**Enhanced Progress Sync processes:**
1. Reads `pending_actions.json`
2. Groups by priority (üî¥ HIGH, üü° MEDIUM, üü¢ LOW)
3. Writes `reports/execution_progress_update.md`

**Minutes 30-60: Executive Execution (6 cycles)**
- Cycle 1-2 (0-10 min): Execute HIGH priority tasks
- Cycle 3-4 (10-20 min): Execute MEDIUM priority tasks
- Cycle 5-6 (20-30 min): Execute LOW priority tasks

**Minute 60: Next Planning Meeting**
- Reviews execution results
- Adjusts strategy
- Creates new actions
- Cycle continues...

### Priority-Based Execution Feature

**NEW as of October 14, 2025:**

Executive Team now sees actions grouped by priority in `execution_progress_update.md`:

```markdown
## üéØ Next Actions to Execute (By Priority)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY (Execute First)
**1. Deploy V1.0 to shadow environment**
   - Owner: ops_commander
   - Duration: 5min
   - Success Criteria: Model deployed, no errors, smoke tests pass

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Execute After High)
**1. Collect baseline metrics**
   - Owner: compliance_monitor
   - Duration: 2min
   - Success Criteria: All SLOs measured and logged

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Execute After Medium)
**1. Generate deployment report**
   - Owner: integration_engineer
   - Duration: 1min
   - Success Criteria: Report includes all metrics
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Clear visual priority with emojis
- Complete task context (no transcript reading needed)
- Explicit owner assignment
- Measurable success criteria
- Efficient resource allocation

---

## System 2: Unified Single-Team System (Research Execution)

### Purpose
Execute CVPR 2025 research agenda with focus on attention collapse phenomenon and multimodal fusion experiments.

### Architecture
```
Unified Team (8+ agents) - Plan AND execute in single meeting
   - Discusses research direction
   - Makes decisions
   - Executes experiments
   - All in one session
```

### Verification Results

#### ‚úÖ Core Files (Google Drive)
- ‚úÖ `unified_coordinator.py` (113KB)

#### ‚úÖ State Management
- ‚úÖ `state/` directory exists
- ‚úÖ `reports/` directory exists

#### ‚úÖ Recent Activity
- ‚úÖ Transcripts: **3 files** (recent meetings conducted)
- ‚úÖ Actions: **1 file** (action items created)

#### ‚úÖ Python Dependencies
- ‚úÖ anthropic
- ‚úÖ json
- ‚úÖ pathlib
- ‚úÖ datetime

#### ‚úÖ API Keys
- ‚úÖ Shares same `research/api_keys.env` with old system
- ‚úÖ All 3 API keys configured

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Handoff Directory (Informational Only)
- ‚úÖ `reports/handoff/README.md` (3KB)
- Explains why unified system doesn't use handoff mechanism
- Documents difference from two-tier system

### How to Launch

```bash
# Navigate to unified-team directory in Google Drive
cd "/Users/guyan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-rc989@cornell.edu/ÊàëÁöÑ‰∫ëÁ´ØÁ°¨Áõò/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/unified-team"

# Run coordinator
python3 unified_coordinator.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Unified Coordinator initialized
   Agents: 8+ (dynamic selection)
   Mode: Single-team planning + execution

üéØ Starting research meeting...
```

### How Unified System Works

**Single Meeting Cycle:**
1. **Planning Phase** (first 30% of meeting)
   - Agents discuss research direction
   - Analyze previous results
   - Make go/no-go decisions

2. **Execution Phase** (remaining 70% of meeting)
   - Same agents execute experiments
   - Run code, collect results
   - Document findings

3. **Output:**
   - `reports/transcript_*.md` - Full conversation (planning + execution)
   - `reports/summary_*.md` - Meeting summary
   - `reports/actions_*.json` - Action items (may have fragments!)

### Key Difference: Action Format

**Unified system intentionally uses action fragments:**

```json
{
  "type": "experiment",
  "description": "tracking in MLflow",  ‚Üê Fragment (by design!)
  "agent": "research_director",
  "priority": "medium"
}
```

**Why fragments are OK here:**
- Agents read **full transcript** for complete context
- Actions.json used ONLY for priority levels
- Planning and execution happen in same meeting
- No handoff between teams

**Contrast with old system:**
- Old system: Complete descriptions (no transcript reading)
- Unified system: Fragments + full transcript (single team)

### Old System (Two-Tier):
```
Current State: ‚úÖ Ready to launch
   ‚Üì
First Planning Meeting (30 min)
   ‚Üì
Create pending_actions.json with priorities
   ‚Üì
Enhanced Progress Sync groups by priority
   ‚Üì
Executive Team executes: HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW
   ‚Üì
Results fed back to next planning meeting
   ‚Üì
Progressive V1.0 deployment continues...
```

### Unified System:
```
Current State: ‚úÖ Already running, ready to continue
   ‚Üì
Next meeting triggered (on-demand or scheduled)
   ‚Üì
Team plans AND executes in single session
   ‚Üì
Full transcript + action fragments recorded
   ‚Üì
CVPR 2025 research experiments progress...
```

---

## Success Criteria

### First Hour - Old System

After 60 minutes:
- ‚úÖ First planning meeting completed
- ‚úÖ `pending_actions.json` created with priorities
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Progress Sync grouped actions
- ‚úÖ Executive Team read prioritized actions
- ‚úÖ HIGH priority tasks executed
- ‚úÖ MEDIUM priority tasks executed
- ‚úÖ LOW priority tasks executed
- ‚úÖ Results logged in `state/decision_log.json`
- ‚úÖ Second planning meeting started

### First Meeting - Unified System

After one meeting:
- ‚úÖ Research discussion completed
- ‚úÖ Experiments executed
- ‚úÖ Transcript saved
- ‚úÖ Actions recorded (with priorities)
- ‚úÖ Results documented
- ‚úÖ Next meeting scheduled

---

## Troubleshooting

### Old System

**Issue: No pending_actions.json after planning meeting**

Check:
```bash
# Did meeting complete?
grep "Meeting complete" reports/planning/transcript_*.md

# Was actions file created?
ls -lt reports/planning/actions_*.json
```

**Solution:** Planning Team will create `pending_actions.json` in handoff/ directory. If missing, check meeting logs.

**Issue: Executive Team not executing**

Check:
```bash
# Does handoff file exist?
ls -lh reports/handoff/pending_actions.json

# Is it valid JSON?
cat reports/handoff/pending_actions.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Unified System

**Issue: Meeting not starting**

Check API keys are loaded and system has network access to API providers.

**Issue: Action fragments unclear**

This is intentional! Agents read full transcript for context. Check `transcript_*.md` for complete discussion.

---

## Key Differences Summary

### Old System:
- **Complete actions.json** - No transcript reading needed
- **Two-tier architecture** - Planning and execution separated
- **Priority-based execution** - HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW
- **Continuous operation** - 24/7 monitoring
- **Production focus** - V1.0 deployment

### Unified System:
- **Action fragments + transcript** - Full context in transcript
- **Single-team architecture** - Plan and execute together
- **Priority levels** - For task ordering
- **On-demand operation** - Meetings as needed
- **Research focus** - CVPR 2025 experiments
