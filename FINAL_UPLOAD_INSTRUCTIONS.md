## Step-by-Step Upload Process

### Step 1: Upload .env (API keys)

1. Go to drive.google.com
2. Navigate to: `My Drive > cv_multimodal > project > computer-vision`
3. Click "New" → "File upload"
4. Browse to: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/.env`
   - **Tip**: Press `Cmd+Shift+.` in file picker to see hidden files
5. Select `.env` and upload

### Step 2: Upload autonomous_coordinator.py

1. In Drive, navigate to: `cv_multimodal > project > computer-vision > multi-agent`
2. **Delete** the old `autonomous_coordinator.py` if it exists
3. Click "New" → "File upload"
4. Browse to: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent/`
5. Select `autonomous_coordinator.py` and upload

### Step 3: Upload autonomous_coordination.yaml

1. In Drive, navigate to: `cv_multimodal > project > computer-vision > multi-agent > configs`
2. **Delete** the old `autonomous_coordination.yaml` if it exists
3. Click "New" → "File upload"
4. Browse to: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent/configs/`
5. Select `autonomous_coordination.yaml` and upload

### Step 4: Upload autonomous_system_colab.ipynb

1. In Drive, navigate to: `cv_multimodal > project > computer-vision > research > colab`
2. **Delete** the old `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb` if it exists
3. Click "New" → "File upload"
4. Browse to: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/research/colab/`
5. Select `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb` and upload

## Quick Upload Script (Alternative)

If you have Google Drive desktop app or `rclone` installed:

```bash
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision

# Copy to Google Drive (if using Drive desktop app)
cp .env ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/
cp multi-agent/autonomous_coordinator.py ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/multi-agent/
cp multi-agent/configs/autonomous_coordination.yaml ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/multi-agent/configs/
cp research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/research/colab/
```

## After Upload: Run in Colab

1. Go to drive.google.com
2. Navigate to: `cv_multimodal > project > computer-vision > research > colab`
3. Right-click `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`
4. Select "Open with" → "Google Colaboratory"
5. Click "Runtime" → "Change runtime type" → Select "GPU" → Save
6. Run cells in order (Runtime → Run all)

## Expected Output

When you run the notebook, you should see:

```
🔍 Auto-detecting project location on Google Drive...

📂 Checking common locations:
✅ Found: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision
   Folders: multi-agent, research, docs, data, tools

✅ Found project at: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision
   Contains X Python files in multi-agent/
   ✅ autonomous_coordinator.py found (23.6 KB)
   ✅ autonomous_coordination.yaml found (34.7 KB)

📁 Drive project: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision
📁 Drive root: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal
📁 Local project: /content/cv_project
📁 Results save to: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/results
```

Then continuing with API keys:

```
🔑 Loading API keys from: .env

✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = sk-ant-api...
✅ OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-...
✅ GOOGLE_API_KEY = AIzaSy...

✅ API keys loaded
```

## Verification Checklist

Before running notebook, verify these files exist in Drive:

- [ ] `cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/.env` (362 bytes)
- [ ] `cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/multi-agent/autonomous_coordinator.py` (23 KB)
- [ ] `cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/multi-agent/configs/autonomous_coordination.yaml` (34 KB)
- [ ] `cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb` (32 KB)

## Why These Files?

- **`.env`**: Contains your API keys (NEW - didn't exist before)
- **`autonomous_coordinator.py`**: The main coordinator engine (UPDATED today)
- **`autonomous_coordination.yaml`**: Full system configuration with 15 agents (NEW - created today)
- **`autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`**: Fixed notebook that auto-detects your Drive location (UPDATED today)

## File Locations Summary

**On Your Laptop**: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/`
**On Google Drive**: `MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/`
**Path in Colab**: `/content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/`

## Time Estimate

- Find and upload 4 files: 5-10 minutes
- Upload time (total ~90 KB): < 30 seconds
- Open and run notebook: 2-3 minutes
- **Total**: ~15 minutes

## If You Get Stuck

**Problem**: Can't find `.env` file
- **Solution**: Press `Cmd+Shift+.` in Finder to show hidden files

**Problem**: Upload fails or times out
- **Solution**: Files are small, try again. Check internet connection.

**Problem**: Notebook still says "files not found"
- **Solution**: Wait 30 seconds for Drive to sync, then re-run the cell

**Problem**: Don't see `cv_multimodal` folder in Drive
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the correct Google account

## Summary

**What**: Upload 4 files (1 new, 3 updated)
**Where**: To `cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision/` and subfolders
**Why**: Replace old versions with new versions that have all the fixes
**Time**: 15 minutes
**Result**: Notebook will auto-detect project and start autonomous system
