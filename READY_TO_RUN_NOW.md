# Ready to Run - Quick Start Guide

**Date:** October 14, 2025, 1:05 PM
**Status:** ✅ READY - System configured and topic generated

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**System Running:** ✅ Yes (session_20251014_162454 on Colab)
**Latest Strategic Meeting:** transcript_20251014_033652.md (CVPR planning)
**Context-Rich Topic:** ✅ Generated (NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md)
**Next Meeting:** Will use context-rich execution approach

---

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### The system on Colab will:

1. **Continue autonomous operation** (every 120 minutes)
2. **Use NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md** for next execution meeting
3. **Force agents to read full transcript** (not just broken actions.json)
4. **Execute tasks with full context** (no missing info)
5. **Generate new topic** after each meeting (adapts to results)

---

## 📊 What to Monitor

### On Colab (Cell #16 - Live Dashboard):

Watch for:
- **Meetings completed:** Should increment every 120 minutes
- **Tools used:** Should be ≥4 per execution meeting
- **Files created:** New scripts, logs, results should appear
- **Trajectory events:** Should log all activities

### In Google Drive (unified-team/reports/):

New files will appear:
- `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Meeting transcripts
- `summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Summaries
- `actions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Action items
- `meeting_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Meeting metadata

---

## ✅ Verification After Each Meeting

### Quick Check (60 seconds):

**On Local Machine:**
```bash
cd "/Users/guyan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-rc989@cornell.edu/我的云端硬盘/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean"

# 1. Check if meeting completed
ls -lt unified-team/reports/ | head -5

# 2. Check tool usage
grep "Tools Executed:" unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md | tail -1

# 3. Verify execution (not just planning)
python3 unified-team/POST_MEETING_EXECUTION_CHECK.py
```

**Expected output (SUCCESS):**
```
✅ EXECUTION MEETING CONFIRMED
Tools executed: 5
Executors active: Research Director, Tech Analyst
New files created: 3
```

### Generate Next Topic:

**After each meeting:**
```bash
# Generate context-rich topic for next meeting
python3 unified-team/generate_context_rich_topic.py

# Check what was generated
head -100 unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md
```

---

## 🔄 Automated Workflow (Recommendation)

### Option 1: Keep Colab Running (Current)

- ✅ Colab handles everything automatically
- ✅ Meetings every 120 minutes
- ⚠️ Manual topic generation recommended after each meeting

### Option 2: Add Post-Meeting Hook (Future)

Modify Colab notebook to auto-generate topics:

```python
# In meeting loop, after each meeting:
result = coordinator.run_meeting(topic)

# Auto-generate next topic
subprocess.run(['python3', 'unified-team/generate_context_rich_topic.py'])

# Next iteration uses generated topic
topic = open('unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md').read()
```

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch

### Warning Sign 1: Tools Executed = 0

**What it means:** Planning meeting, not execution
**Check:** Was this expected? (First meeting might be planning)
**Action:** If execution expected, review meeting topic

### Warning Sign 2: No New Files

**What it means:** No concrete work produced
**Check:** Look in research/, unified-team/experiments/, unified-team/scripts/
**Action:** Verify agents have write permissions

### Warning Sign 3: Same Tasks Repeated

**What it means:** Topic generation not adapting
**Check:** Compare NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md across meetings
**Action:** Ensure context-rich generator is being used

### Warning Sign 4: Agents Confused

**What it means:** Missing context from transcript
**Check:** Read meeting transcript for agent responses
**Action:** Verify topic mandates transcript reading

---

## 📁 Key Files to Track

### On Google Drive:

**Reports (unified-team/reports/):**
- Latest transcript: Evidence of what was discussed
- Latest actions: Priority levels for tasks
- Latest summary: Quick overview of decisions

**Session (sessions/session_20251014_162454/):**
- Trajectories: Complete meeting history
- Checkpoints: Saved after every 3 meetings

**Topics (unified-team/):**
- NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md: Auto-generated for next meeting
- WEEK_1_MEETING_TOPIC.md: Original Week 1 plan (reference)

### On Local Machine:

**Verification Scripts:**
- POST_MEETING_EXECUTION_CHECK.py: Verify execution happened
- generate_context_rich_topic.py: Generate next topic

**Documentation:**
- SOLUTION_TO_MISSING_INFO_PROBLEM.md: Explains missing info fix
- ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_SYSTEM.md: Dynamic tasks guide

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Tip 1: Check After Each Meeting

Don't wait until end of day. Verify execution immediately:
```bash
python3 unified-team/POST_MEETING_EXECUTION_CHECK.py
```

### Tip 2: Generate Topics Promptly

After each meeting, generate next topic:
```bash
python3 unified-team/generate_context_rich_topic.py
```

### Tip 3: Read Transcripts

If something seems wrong, read the transcript:
```bash
tail -200 unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md
```

### Tip 4: Monitor Colab Dashboard

Keep an eye on Cell #16 output for live progress:
- Meetings completed count
- Tools used count
- Cost tracking
- Next meeting countdown

### Tip 5: Trust the System

The system is designed to:
- ✅ Read full transcripts automatically
- ✅ Extract tasks with context
- ✅ Execute in priority order
- ✅ Save all results
- ✅ Generate next topic adaptively

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: No meetings happening

**Check Colab:**
- Is notebook still running?
- Any error messages in output?
- Is Drive still mounted?

**Solution:**
- Restart Colab cell if needed
- Re-run initialization cells

### Issue: Meetings but no execution (Tools = 0)

**Check meeting topic:**
```bash
cat unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md | head -50
```

**Verify it has:**
- Warning about actions.json
- Mandatory transcript reading
- Execution requirements

**If missing, regenerate:**
```bash
python3 unified-team/generate_context_rich_topic.py
```

### Issue: Agents seem confused

**Read latest transcript:**
```bash
tail -100 unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md
```

**Look for:**
- Did agents read transcript?
- Do they reference specific lines?
- Are they guessing what to do?

**If confused, check topic forces transcript reading.**

### Issue: Tasks not adapting

**Check actions.json:**
```bash
cat unified-team/reports/actions_*.json | tail -50
```

**Verify:**
- Are action items being saved?
- Do they have priorities?

**Generate new topic:**
```bash
python3 unified-team/generate_context_rich_topic.py
```

---

## 📞 Quick Reference Commands

**Check latest meeting:**
```bash
ls -lt unified-team/reports/ | head -5
```

**Verify execution:**
```bash
python3 unified-team/POST_MEETING_EXECUTION_CHECK.py
```

**Generate next topic:**
```bash
python3 unified-team/generate_context_rich_topic.py
```

**Check tool usage:**
```bash
grep "Tools Executed:" unified-team/reports/transcript_*.md | tail -1
```

**Monitor system:**
```bash
# In Colab, Cell #16 shows live dashboard
```
