# Which Cells to Run - Quick Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Context:** You have Cycle 2 results from today (execution_summary_20251015_151614.md)
**Question:** Which cells to run to execute the agent code?

---

## 🎯 Recommended: Option 2 (Reuse Existing Results)

**Since you already ran Cycle 2 today**, you can save time by just executing the agent code from existing results.

### **Steps (30-90 minutes):**

1. **Add Cell 11.5** (5 minutes)
   - Open notebook in Colab
   - Add Cell 11.5 code executor (see COLAB_CHECKLIST.md)

2. **Fix Cell 14** (1 minute)
   - Remove `[:1000]` truncation

3. **Load existing results** (1 minute)
   - Run Cells 1-10 (setup, load tracker)

4. **Execute agent code** (30-60 minutes)
   - Run Cell 11.5 only
   - It will read existing agent responses from tracker
   - Execute the code they wrote
   - Capture MLflow run_ids

5. **Verify evidence** (1 minute)
   - Run Cell 16/17 (Phase 5.5 verification)
   - Should now pass with real run_ids

---

## ⚠️ Problem: Tracker State Not Persisted

**Issue:** The `tracker.task_results` from your earlier run is in memory, not saved to disk.

When you close Colab or restart runtime, it's gone.

**Solution:** You have two options:

---

## 🔄 Option A: Run All (Fresh Start - 90 minutes)

**Best if:** You want a clean execution from scratch

**Steps:**
1. Add Cell 11.5
2. Fix Cell 14 truncation
3. Runtime → Restart runtime
4. Runtime → Run all
5. Wait for completion

**Timeline:**
- Setup: 2 minutes
- Task execution (Cell 12): 5 minutes (agents write code)
- Code execution (Cell 11.5): 60-90 minutes (execute code, create MLflow runs)
- Reports: 2 minutes
- **Total: ~90 minutes**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clean, reproducible
- ✅ Everything runs in order
- ✅ Guaranteed to work

**Cons:**
- ⏱️ Takes full 90 minutes
- 🔄 Agents re-write same code

---

## ⚡ Option B: Just Run Cell 11.5 (If Runtime Still Active - 60 minutes)

**Best if:** Your Colab runtime is still active from the earlier run

**Check if runtime is active:**
```python
# Run this in Colab
try:
    print(f"Tracker has {len(tracker.task_results)} tasks")
    print("✅ Runtime is active, tracker still has data")
except NameError:
    print("❌ Runtime was restarted, tracker is empty")
    print("→ Use Option A (Run All) instead")
```

**If runtime is active:**
1. Add Cell 11.5
2. Fix Cell 14
3. Just run Cell 11.5
4. Run Cell 16/17 (Phase 5.5)

**Timeline:**
- Code execution: 60-90 minutes
- **Total: ~60 minutes**

**Pros:**
- ⚡ Faster - reuses agent responses
- 💰 Saves GPU time

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Only works if runtime is active
- ⚠️ If runtime restarted, tracker.task_results is empty

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation

### **Most likely scenario:**

You closed Colab or runtime was disconnected → tracker.task_results is gone.

**Therefore: Use Option A (Run All)**

**Steps:**
1. Open Colab notebook
2. Add Cell 11.5 (copy from COLAB_CHECKLIST.md)
3. Fix Cell 14 line 41 (change to `{response}`)
4. Click: Runtime → Restart runtime
5. Click: Runtime → Run all
6. Go get coffee ☕ (90 minutes)

**What will happen:**
```
Cell 1-10: Setup (2 min)
  → Loads libraries, connects to Drive
  → Initializes tracker

Cell 11: TaskExecutionTracker (instant)
  → Defines tracker class

Cell 12: Task Execution (5 min)
  → Agents write code for 3 tasks
  → Stores in tracker.task_results

Cell 11.5: Code Executor (60-90 min) ← NEW
  → Extracts code from agent responses
  → Executes code
  → Creates MLflow runs
  → Captures run_ids
  → Updates tracker.task_results

Cell 13-15: Progress reports (2 min)
  → Generates reports with execution results

Cell 16/17: Phase 5.5 (instant)
  → Verifies evidence
  → ✅ PASSES (finds run_ids)

Cell 18-21: Final reports (1 min)
  → Saves everything
```

## ✅ Verification After Run

Check these to confirm success:

### **1. MLflow runs created:**
```python
# In a new cell
from pathlib import Path
mlflow_dir = MULTI_AGENT_ROOT / "mlruns"
experiments = list(mlflow_dir.glob('*/'))
print(f"MLflow experiments: {len(experiments)}")
for exp in experiments:
    if exp.name not in ['.trash', '0']:
        runs = list(exp.glob('*/'))
        print(f"  {exp.name}: {len(runs)} runs")
```

**Expected:**
```
MLflow experiments: 3
  week1_clip_integration: 1 runs
  week1_clip_diagnostic: 1 runs
  week1_align_or_fallback_diagnostic: 1 runs
```

### **2. Result files created:**
```python
# Check result files
results_dir = MULTI_AGENT_ROOT / "runs"
for task_dir in results_dir.glob('*/'):
    files = list(task_dir.glob('*'))
    print(f"{task_dir.name}: {len(files)} files")
    for f in files:
        print(f"  - {f.name} ({f.stat().st_size} bytes)")
```

**Expected:**
```
clip_integration: 3 files
  - baseline_attention.json (4521 bytes)
  - gpu_config.json (892 bytes)
  - setup.md (1234 bytes)

clip_diagnostic: 3 files
  - mcs_results.json (3210 bytes)
  - attention_heatmaps.pdf (5678 bytes)
  - statistical_tests.json (432 bytes)
```

### **3. Phase 5.5 passed:**
```python
# Check final execution summary
summary_file = max(Path(MULTI_AGENT_ROOT / "reports/execution/summaries").glob("execution_summary_*.md"))
with open(summary_file) as f:
    content = f.read()
    if "✅ EVIDENCE VERIFICATION PASSED" in content:
        print("✅ Phase 5.5 PASSED")
    else:
        print("❌ Phase 5.5 FAILED")
```

## 🎯 Summary

**What to do RIGHT NOW:**

1. ✅ Add Cell 11.5 to notebook
2. ✅ Fix Cell 14 line 41
3. ✅ Runtime → Restart runtime
4. ✅ Runtime → Run all
5. ⏱️ Wait 90 minutes
6. ✅ Verify results

**Don't try to run individual cells** - just run all from scratch for clean execution.

## 📞 Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have Cell 11.5 in notebook?
├─ NO → Add it first (see COLAB_CHECKLIST.md)
└─ YES → Runtime → Run all

Is your Colab runtime still active?
├─ Don't know / Not sure → Runtime → Restart → Run all
├─ YES and tracker has data → Just run Cell 11.5 + Phase 5.5
└─ NO / Restarted → Runtime → Run all
```

---

**Status:** Ready to run
**Time:** ~90 minutes for full run
**Result:** Real MLflow runs + Phase 5.5 passes + GO/NO-GO data!

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION: Add Cell 11.5 → Fix Cell 14 → Runtime → Run all**
