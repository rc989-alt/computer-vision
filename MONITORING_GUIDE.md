---

## How to Monitor Progress

### Option 1: Watch for New Report Files
```bash
# In a terminal, watch for new reports
watch -n 5 'ls -lht /path/to/Google Drive/multi-agent/reports/*.md | head -5'
```

The meeting will create these files when complete:
- `summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Meeting summary
- `transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Full discussion
- `actions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Action items
- `integrity_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Quality check

### Option 2: Check Your Colab Monitoring Cell
The status display you showed indicates:
```
üìä Current Phase: üéØ PLANNING MEETING IN PROGRESS
‚è∞ Next cycle in 4.3 minutes...
üìÖ Next planning meeting: 30.0 minutes
```

When meeting completes, you'll see:
```
üìä Current Phase: ‚öñÔ∏è ACTION EXECUTION
‚úÖ Meeting complete!
üìä Agents participated: 6
üìã Actions identified: 10-15
üîç Integrity check: PASS
```

### Option 3: View the Log File
If you're in Colab, check the log:
```python
!tail -n 50 /content/executive_coordinator.log
```

Look for lines like:
```
[TIMESTAMP]    ‚úÖ Meeting complete!
[TIMESTAMP]    üìä Agents participated: 6
[TIMESTAMP]    üìã Actions identified: 12
[TIMESTAMP]    üîç Integrity check: PASS
```

## What to Look For After Meeting

### ‚úÖ Good Signs

**1. Meeting Completed Successfully**
```
‚úÖ Meeting complete!
üìä Agents participated: 6
üìã Actions identified: 10-15
üîç Integrity check: PASS
‚è±Ô∏è  Meeting duration: 20-25 minutes
```

**2. CVPR-Focused Actions Created**
Check `actions_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` for:
- Actions mentioning "CVPR" or "paper"
- Experiment designs (baseline, mitigation strategies)
- Week 1 timeline items
- Statistical validation plans

Example good actions:
```json
[
  {
    "action": "Run baseline attention analysis on V2 model to document 0.15% visual contribution",
    "owner": "Tech Analysis",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "deadline": "Oct 15"
  },
  {
    "action": "Search recent CVPR papers on multimodal fusion and attention collapse",
    "owner": "Research Director",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "deadline": "Oct 14"
  },
  {
    "action": "Implement Modality-Balanced Loss with Œª_visual = 0.3",
    "owner": "Tech Analysis",
    "priority": "HIGH",
    "deadline": "Oct 17"
  }
]
```

**3. Research Direction Consensus**
Check `summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` for:
- Clear statement of chosen paper angle (Option A, B, C, D, or E)
- Team consensus on feasibility
- Week 1 experiments defined
- GO/NO-GO criteria specified

Example good summary:
```markdown
## Consensus Decision

**Selected Paper Angle:** Option A - "Diagnosing and Fixing Attention Collapse in Multimodal Fusion"

**Rationale:**
- We have the problem (V2's 0.15% visual contribution)
- We have the tools (attention_analysis.py)
- We have solutions (Modality-Balanced Loss, Progressive Fusion)
- Timeline is achievable (24-31 days)
- Novel enough for CVPR (systematic diagnosis framework)

**Week 1 Plan:**
- Days 1-2: Baseline characterization
- Days 3-5: Implement Modality-Balanced Loss
- Days 6-7: Implement Progressive Fusion
- Day 7: GO/NO-GO decision
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs

**1. Meeting Taking Too Long**
- If meeting exceeds 30 minutes ‚Üí May still be using old config
- Check: Are all 6 agents responding? Or is it still showing 8+ agents?

**2. Wrong Meeting Focus**
- If actions mention "V1 deployment" or "shadow stage" ‚Üí Wrong topic
- If no mention of "CVPR" or "paper" ‚Üí Wrong topic

**3. No Research Director Participation**
- If summary doesn't mention Research Director ‚Üí Agent not loaded
- If only 5 agents participated instead of 6 ‚Üí Config issue

**4. Integrity Check Failed**
```
üîç Integrity check: FAIL
‚ö†Ô∏è  Low consensus score
‚ö†Ô∏è  Conflicting recommendations
```
This means agents didn't reach agreement. System will retry in next meeting.

- ‚úÖ Good: "üéì CVPR 2025 PAPER SUBMISSION"
- ‚ùå Bad: "V1.0 Lightweight Enhancer Deployment"

### Is Research Director Active?
**Check:** Summary mentions Research Director
- ‚úÖ Good: "Research Director recommends Option A..."

## What to Do If Issues Occur

### Issue 1: Meeting Still Too Long (30+ minutes)

**Cause:** Config not reloaded properly

**Fix:**
1. Stop Colab runtime
2. Runtime ‚Üí Restart runtime
3. Run all cells again
4. System will reload from Drive

### Issue 2: Wrong Meeting Topic (V1 deployment)

**Cause:** Old executive_coordinator.py loaded

**Check:**
```python
!grep "CVPR 2025" /content/cv_project/executive_coordinator.py
```

Should show: `üéì CVPR 2025 PAPER SUBMISSION`

**Fix:**
```python
# Force re-sync from Drive
!cp /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/executive_coordinator.py \
   /content/cv_project/
```

### Issue 3: Research Director Not Participating

**Cause:** meeting.yaml not updated or prompt file missing

**Check:**
```python
!grep "research_director" /content/cv_project/multi-agent/configs/meeting.yaml
```

Should show:
```yaml
research_director:
  name: "Research Director"
```

**Fix:**
```python
# Re-sync config
!cp /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/multi-agent/configs/meeting.yaml \
   /content/cv_project/multi-agent/configs/

# Re-sync prompt
!cp /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/multi-agent/agents/prompts/planning_team/research_director.md \
   /content/cv_project/multi-agent/agents/prompts/planning_team/
```
