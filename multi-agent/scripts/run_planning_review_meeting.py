## üéØ Your Task: Review and Plan Next Cycle

As the Planning Team, your job is to:

### 1. **Review Execution Results**
- Which tasks completed successfully?
- Which tasks failed? Why?
- What outputs were generated?
- Is there evidence (MLflow run_ids, file paths)?

### 2. **Assess Progress Toward Goals**

**Week 1 Goal:** Determine if attention collapse is widespread across multimodal architectures

**Key Questions:**
- Are we moving toward the Week 1 GO/NO-GO decision (Oct 20)?
- Do we have statistical evidence? (p<0.05 threshold)
- Have we tested ‚â•2 models? (CLIP, ALIGN, etc.)
- Are results reproducible? (MLflow tracking)

**Decision Criteria:**
- **GO:** ‚â•2 models show >80% attention imbalance ‚Üí Field-wide paper
- **PIVOT:** Only V2 shows collapse ‚Üí Focused case study
- **DIAGNOSTIC:** Tools work on all models ‚Üí Framework contribution

### 3. **Identify Next Priorities**

Based on execution results, what should happen in the next cycle?

**If HIGH tasks completed:**
- Move to MEDIUM priority tasks
- Start next phase of validation
- Begin writing paper outline

**If HIGH tasks failed:**
- Debug failures
- Re-run with fixes
- Adjust approach

**Blockers to address:**
- Missing dependencies
- Environment issues
- Resource constraints

### 4. **Generate New pending_actions.json**

Create a detailed plan for the next execution cycle.

**Format:**
```json
{{
  "meeting_id": "cvpr_planning_cycle2_{{timestamp}}",
  "generated_at": "{{ISO timestamp}}",
  "context": "Week 1 - Cycle 2: [Brief description based on results]",
  "decisions": [
    {{
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "action": "[Specific task based on execution results]",
      "owner": "ops_commander",
      "rationale": "[Why this is needed based on previous results]",
      "deadline": "{{ISO timestamp}}",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "[Specific, measurable criterion]"
      ],
      "evidence_paths": ["[File paths for verification]"]
    }}
  ],
  "acceptance_gates": {{
    "week1_validation": {{
      "min_models_tested": 3,
      "min_models_with_collapse": 2,
      "statistical_threshold": "p<0.05"
    }}
  }}
}}
```

## ü§ñ Planning Team Roles

**Strategic Leader (Opus 4):**
- Lead this meeting
- Synthesize team input
- Create final pending_actions.json
- Make GO/PAUSE/PIVOT decisions

**Empirical Validation Lead (Sonnet 4):**
- Assess statistical validity of results
- Verify experimental rigor
- Recommend next experiments

**Critical Evaluator (GPT-4):**
- Challenge claims (is evidence sufficient?)
- Identify methodological risks
- Flag reproducibility issues

**Gemini Research Advisor (Gemini Flash):**
- Provide context from literature
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Assess feasibility of next steps

---

## üì§ Required Output

**1. Assessment of Current Results:**
- What worked?
- What failed?
- What did we learn?

**2. Decision on Next Steps:**
- Continue with current approach?
- Pivot to different strategy?
- Focus on debugging?

**3. New pending_actions.json:**
- 4-7 tasks for next cycle
- Prioritized (HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW)
- Based on execution results
- Clear acceptance criteria

**4. Updated Timeline:**
- Are we on track for Week 1 GO/NO-GO (Oct 20)?
- Do we need to accelerate/adjust?

---

## üö® Critical Thinking Required

**Don't just continue blindly:**
- If CLIP diagnostic failed, why? Should we retry or change approach?
- If CLIP shows no attention collapse, what does that mean for our hypothesis?
- If we're behind schedule, what can we cut or parallelize?
- If we're ahead, what stretch goals can we add?

**Evidence-based decisions:**
- Every priority must be justified by execution results
- Every new task must cite what previous results showed
- Every deadline must account for available time

---

## ‚è∞ Timeline Reminder

**Today:** {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}
**Week 1 GO/NO-GO:** October 20, 2025 (6 days from now)
**Abstract Deadline:** November 6, 2025
**Full Paper Deadline:** November 13, 2025

Make smart decisions based on time constraints.

**Begin your review now. Create a thoughtful, evidence-based plan for the next cycle.**
