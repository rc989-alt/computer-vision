# Strategic Analysis Meeting - Computer Vision Multimodal Project

## Context
This is a comprehensive strategic review of our computer vision pipeline project.
All agents have access to local files in the research/ directory and should analyze
actual results and data to inform recommendations.

## Meeting Objectives

### 1. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
**Analyze actual experiment results from local files:**
- V1 Production Line (`research/01_v1_production_line/`)
  - Status: ‚úÖ Deployed (+14.2% compliance improvement)
  - Performance: Stable, proven in production

- V2 Research Line (`research/02_v2_research_line/`)
  - Latest results: `production_evaluation.json` shows thresholds NOT MET
  - Scientific review: `v2_scientific_review_report.json` reveals:
    * ‚úÖ Statistical significance: nDCG +0.011 (CI95 [+0.0101, +0.0119])
    * ‚ùå Integrity issues: Visual features masked with minimal performance drop
    * ‚ùå High correlation (0.99+) between V1/V2 scores suggests linear shift only
    * Decision: PAUSE_AND_FIX (not discard, but needs integrity fixes)

- CoTRR Lightweight Line (`research/03_cotrr_lightweight_line/`)
  - Status: Explored 21 optimization approaches
  - Findings: Some promising directions, needs strategic focus

**Key Data Points to Reference:**
- `research/02_v2_research_line/production_evaluation.json`
- `research/02_v2_research_line/v2_scientific_review_report.json`
- `research/02_v2_research_line/V2_Rescue_Plan_Executive_Summary.md`

### 2. DATA INTEGRITY ANALYSIS
**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Visual Feature Anomaly**: Masking visual features causes <0.2% performance drop
   - Indicates potential feature redundancy or insufficient multimodal fusion
   - Evidence: `v2_scientific_review_report.json#feature_ablation`

2. **Score Correlation Concern**: V1/V2 correlation 0.99+
   - Suggests V2 may be doing simple linear transformation of V1 scores
   - Not true multimodal innovation
   - Evidence: `v2_scientific_review_report.json#score_verification`

3. **Threshold Failures**:
   - Compliance improvement: 13.8% actual vs 15% target ‚ùå
   - NDCG improvement: 1.14% actual vs 8% target ‚ùå
   - Low margin rate: 0.98 actual vs 0.1 target ‚ùå
   - Evidence: `production_evaluation.json#thresholds_met`

### 3. MISTAKE ANALYSIS
**What went wrong? Each agent should analyze:**
- Why did V2 multimodal fusion show minimal visual feature contribution?
- Were our evaluation methods sufficient to catch these issues early?
- What architectural decisions led to high V1/V2 score correlation?
- How can we prevent similar issues in future multimodal research?

### 4. NEW STRATEGIC PLANNING

**SHORT-TERM GOALS (Next 2-4 weeks):**
- Should we invest in fixing V2's integrity issues or pivot to new approaches?
- What are the highest-ROI improvements for V1 production system?
- How to design better evaluation frameworks for multimodal systems?

**MEDIUM-TERM GOALS (1-3 months):**
- Define next-generation multimodal architecture with proper fusion
- Establish production-ready pipeline with all guardrails
- Set up continuous validation and monitoring systems

**LONG-TERM VISION (3-6 months):**
- True multimodal fusion with proven independent feature contributions
- Candidate generation + reranking pipeline
- Data flywheel and personalization capabilities

### 5. ACTIONABLE DELIVERABLES
Each agent should provide:
- **Specific action items** with priorities (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Success metrics** for each proposed goal
- **Resource estimates** (time, compute, team effort)
- **Risk mitigation** strategies for identified issues
- **Evidence-based recommendations** citing actual data files

## Agent-Specific Focus Areas

**V1 Production Team**: Focus on production stability, incremental improvements, and
proven optimization strategies. Defend the value of stable, working systems.

**V2 Scientific Team**: Analyze integrity issues objectively. Propose fixes or
alternative research directions. Don't be defensive - be scientific.

**CoTRR Team**: Evaluate lightweight optimization opportunities. Consider practical
deployment constraints and efficiency improvements.

**Tech Analysis**: Deep dive into architectural issues. Propose technical solutions
for multimodal fusion problems and evaluation framework improvements.

**Critic**: Challenge assumptions. Question whether we're solving the right problems.
Identify potential blind spots in current analysis.

**Integrity Guardian**: Ensure all claims are backed by evidence. Flag any
inconsistencies. Verify that proposed actions address root causes.

**Data Analyst**: Extract insights from experiment results. Identify patterns in
what worked and what didn't. Propose data-driven decision frameworks.

**Moderator**: Synthesize diverse perspectives into actionable strategy. Highlight
consensus areas and resolve conflicts. Create clear decision framework.

## Expected Output
- Comprehensive analysis of current state
- Clear diagnosis of what went wrong with V2
- Prioritized action plan for next phase
- Strategic roadmap for multimodal vision project
- Decision framework: Fix V2 vs Pivot vs Hybrid approach

---
**Note**: All agents should reference actual files in `research/` directory to support
their analysis. Use specific numbers, file paths, and evidence in recommendations.
