## 📁 System Components

### **1. Colab Execution Notebook**
**File:** `research/colab/cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb`

**Features:**
- 📥 Reads `pending_actions.json` from Planning Team
- 🎯 Executes tasks in priority order (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
- 🔧 Uses real deployment tools (Python, MLflow, GPU)
- 📊 Tracks progress with TaskExecutionTracker
- 📤 Generates `execution_progress_update.md`
- 🔄 Auto-syncs to Google Drive every 5 seconds
- 📈 Creates execution dashboard (charts, metrics)

**Phases:**
1. Setup: Mount Drive, load API keys, install dependencies
2. Read pending actions from Planning Team
3. Initialize Executive Team agents (3 agents)
4. Execute tasks in priority order
5. Generate progress report
6. Auto-sync to Google Drive
7. Create trigger for next Planning Team meeting

### **2. Cycle Coordinator**
**File:** `multi-agent/autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py`

**Features:**
- 🔄 Manages Planning-Executive cycles
- ⏸️ Manual checkpoints between cycles
- 💾 Persists cycle state to disk
- 📊 Tracks cycle history
- 🎯 Validates handoff files exist
- 📋 Triggers Planning Team meetings

**Commands:**
```bash
cd multi-agent
python autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py

# Options:
# 1. Run single cycle (with manual checkpoints)
# 2. Start continuous autonomous system
# 3. Check system status
```

### **3. Handoff Files**

**Planning → Executive:**
- `reports/handoff/pending_actions.json` - Task list with priorities

**Executive → Planning:**
- `reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md` - Results summary
- `reports/execution/results/execution_results_*.json` - Detailed results
- `reports/handoff/next_meeting_trigger.json` - Next meeting metadata

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Step 1: First Planning Team Meeting (Already Complete)**

✅ Week 1 pending actions created:
- `reports/handoff/pending_actions.json` (7 tasks, 4 HIGH priority)
- `reports/handoff/CVPR_WEEK1_HANDOFF_TO_EXECUTIVE_TEAM.md`

### **Step 2: Run Executive Team Cycle in Colab**

1. **Open Google Colab:**
   ```
   https://colab.research.google.com/
   ```

2. **Upload notebook:**
   ```
   research/colab/cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run all cells** (Ctrl+F9 or Runtime → Run all)

4. **Monitor execution:**
   - ✅ Tasks execute in priority order
   - ✅ Progress tracked in real-time
   - ✅ Results auto-sync to Google Drive

5. **Check outputs:**
   - `reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md`
   - `reports/execution/results/execution_results_*.json`
   - `reports/execution/results/execution_dashboard_*.png`

### **Step 3: Manual Checkpoint Review**

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Read `execution_progress_update.md`
- [ ] Check task completion: How many HIGH tasks done?
- [ ] Verify outputs exist (files, MLflow run_ids)
- [ ] Check for errors or blockers
- [ ] Assess progress toward Week 1 GO/NO-GO criteria

**Decision:**
- ✅ **Approve:** Continue to next Planning Team meeting
- ⏸️ **Pause:** Fix blockers before continuing
- ❌ **Reject:** Re-execute failed tasks

### **Step 4: Next Planning Team Meeting**

**Run Planning Team to generate next cycle tasks:**

```bash
cd multi-agent
python scripts/run_planning_meeting.py
```

**Planning Team will:**
1. Review `execution_progress_update.md`
2. Assess progress toward goals
3. Identify blockers and risks
4. Plan next cycle tasks
5. Generate new `pending_actions.json`

### **Step 5: Repeat Cycle**

Go back to Step 2 and run Colab notebook again.

## 📊 Cycle Management

### **Using Autonomous Cycle Coordinator**

**Option 1: Single Cycle (Recommended for Week 1)**
```bash
cd multi-agent
python autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py
# Select: 1. Run single cycle
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks `pending_actions.json` exists
2. Instructs you to run Colab notebook
3. Waits for Colab completion (you confirm)
4. Reads `execution_progress_update.md`
5. Displays summary for manual review
6. Asks for approval to continue
7. Triggers next Planning Team meeting
8. Saves cycle state

**Option 2: Continuous Autonomous System**
```bash
python autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py
# Select: 2. Start continuous autonomous system
```

**What it does:**
- Runs cycles continuously
- Manual checkpoint after each cycle
- Asks "Start next cycle?" after each completion
- Persists state between cycles
- Can be paused/resumed

**Option 3: Check Status**
```bash
python autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py
# Select: 3. Check system status
```

**Displays:**
- Current cycle number
- Cycle history (how many cycles completed)
- Handoff file status (pending_actions.json, execution_progress_update.md)

## 📋 Task Execution Rules

### **Priority Execution Order**

```python
# Tasks are executed in strict priority order:
HIGH priority tasks    ⭐ (execute first)
MEDIUM priority tasks  🟠 (execute after HIGH)
LOW priority tasks     🔵 (execute after MEDIUM)
```

### **Dependency Handling**

Tasks can have dependencies:
```json
{
  "action": "Run CLIP diagnostic",
  "dependencies": ["adapt_attention_analysis", "setup_clip_environment"]
}
```

Executive Team checks dependencies before executing.

### **Real Deployment Tools**

Executive Team uses actual deployment tools:
- ✅ Python code execution
- ✅ MLflow experiment tracking
- ✅ GPU resources (A100 on Colab)
- ✅ File I/O to Google Drive
- ✅ External model downloads (CLIP, ALIGN, etc.)

**NOT simulation** - actual research work!

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### **TaskExecutionTracker (in Colab notebook)**

Tracks each task:
```python
tracker.start_task(task_id, action, priority)
tracker.log_agent_response(agent_name, response)
tracker.log_output(output_type, content, file_path)
tracker.log_error(error_msg)
tracker.complete_task(status='completed')  # or 'failed'
```

### **Progress Report Format**

**File:** `execution_progress_update.md`

```markdown

## ⏸️ Manual Checkpoint Guidelines

### **What to Check**

**1. Task Completion:**
- [ ] How many HIGH priority tasks completed?
- [ ] Any tasks failed? Why?
- [ ] Dependencies satisfied?

**2. Output Quality:**
- [ ] Files created in correct locations?
- [ ] MLflow run_ids logged?
- [ ] Evidence paths valid?
- [ ] Code documented?

**3. Progress Toward Goals:**
- [ ] Moving toward Week 1 GO/NO-GO criteria?
- [ ] Statistical significance achieved?
- [ ] Experiments reproducible?

**4. Blockers:**
- [ ] Any errors or exceptions?
- [ ] GPU resources available?
- [ ] External models accessible?

### **Decision Criteria**

**✅ Approve and Continue:**
- Most HIGH tasks completed
- Outputs meet acceptance criteria
- Progress toward goals on track
- No major blockers

**⏸️ Pause for Fixes:**
- Some HIGH tasks failed
- Output quality issues
- Need to debug before continuing

**❌ Reject and Re-Execute:**
- Most tasks failed
- Critical blockers
- Need to redesign approach

## 📈 Monitoring Dashboard

Colab notebook generates execution dashboard:

**File:** `reports/execution/results/execution_dashboard_*.png`

**Charts:**
1. **Task Completion Pie Chart:** Completed vs Failed
2. **Priority Distribution Bar Chart:** HIGH vs MEDIUM vs LOW
3. **Execution Time Bar Chart:** Duration per task

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: pending_actions.json not found**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run Planning Team meeting first
cd multi-agent
python scripts/run_planning_meeting.py
```

### **Problem: Colab execution failed**

**Check:**
1. GPU allocated? (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)
2. API keys loaded? (Check .env file exists)
3. Dependencies installed? (Run setup cells)
4. Google Drive mounted? (Run mount cell)

### **Problem: execution_progress_update.md not generated**

**Check:**
1. All Colab cells ran successfully?
2. File saved to correct path?
3. Google Drive sync completed? (wait 5-10 seconds)

### **Problem: Next Planning Team meeting doesn't read results**

**Solution:**
Ensure `execution_progress_update.md` exists in `reports/handoff/`
