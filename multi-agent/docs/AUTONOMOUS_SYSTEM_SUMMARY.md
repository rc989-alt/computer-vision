## ⚙️ Key Features

### 1. Autonomous Triggers

**Emergency Rollback** (CRITICAL):
- Condition: Compliance drop > 2pts OR latency spike > 10% OR error > 1%
- Action: Immediate rollback to shadow
- Notify: Ops Commander + Rollback Officer

**Stage Progression** (HIGH):
- Condition: All SLOs pass + minimum time elapsed
- Action: Progress shadow → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%
- Notify: Ops Commander + Planning Moderator

**Artifact Scan** (NORMAL):
- Condition: 60 minutes elapsed
- Action: Tech Analysis scans research/ for changes
- Update: artifact_registry.json

**Planning Meeting** (NORMAL):
- Condition: New artifacts > 10 OR days since meeting > 7
- Action: Convene all planning agents
- Output: Decision matrix + execution plan

### 2. Dual-Cycle Operation (Planning + Execution)

**Planning Cycle (Every 30 Minutes):**
- Planning Team meets every 30 minutes
- Generates 15-20 action items with priorities
- Creates `pending_actions.json` handoff file
- Reviews execution results from previous cycle

**Execution Cycle (Every 5 Minutes, 6 cycles per planning):**
```
Minute 0-5:   Cycle 1 → Execute tasks 1-3 (HIGH priority)
Minute 5-10:  Cycle 2 → Execute tasks 4-6 (HIGH priority)
Minute 10-15: Cycle 3 → Execute tasks 7-9 (MEDIUM priority)
Minute 15-20: Cycle 4 → Execute tasks 10-12 (MEDIUM priority)
Minute 20-25: Cycle 5 → Execute tasks 13-15 (LOW priority)
Minute 25-30: Cycle 6 → Execute remaining tasks (LOW priority)
Minute 30:    Next planning meeting (with execution results)
```

**Key Features:**
- **Top 3 priority tasks per cycle**: Focused execution
- **30-minute feedback loop**: Results feed back to planning
- **Continuous execution**: System never idle
- **Priority-driven**: HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW order enforced

### 3. File Editing Permissions

**Planning Team** (Autonomous):
- Edit: `docs/`, `research/plans/`, `research/analysis/`
- Auto-commit: `[Planning] {agent}: {action} {file}`

**Executive Team** (Autonomous):
- Edit: `deploy/`, `ops/`, `multi-agent/state/`
- Auto-commit: `[Ops] {agent}: {action} {file}`

**V2 Scientific** (Autonomous):
- Edit: `research/audits/`, `multi-agent/reports/scientific_*`
- Auto-commit: `[Scientific] V2: {action} {file}`

### 4. Smoke Testing

**During Meetings** (Executive Team):
- Pause meeting when deployment proposed
- Run 3-minute test suite (parallel):
  - Sanity Check (30s)
  - Performance Smoke (60s)
  - Compliance Smoke (60s)
- Report results → GO/NO-GO decision
- Resume meeting with verdict

**Test Suites**:
- Sanity: API reachable, model loads, schemas valid
- Performance: Latency, throughput, memory within 10% baseline
- Compliance: 20-sample validation within 1pt baseline
- Integration: Backward compatible, zero regressions
- Rollback: RTO < 10 min, zero data loss

### 5. Google Colab Integration

**GPU Deployment**:
- Preferred: A100 (40GB, ~$2.50/hr)
- Fallback: V100 → T4
- Auto-authenticate, mount Drive
- Upload model, run tests, download results
- Monitor GPU util, latency, cost

**Workflow**:
1. Preparation: Package model, create notebook
2. Upload: To Google Drive
3. Deploy: Execute cells, monitor logs
4. Validate: Profile performance, check metrics
5. Results: Compare to baseline, make decision

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Hierarchy
**Who reports to whom** - Clear chain of command from Ops Commander down

### Shared Memory
**How agents exchange context** - File-based state stores + in-memory cache

### Triggers
**What activates which agent** - Event-based automation (SLO breach → rollback)

### Hand-offs
**Protocol for transitions** - Planning → Execution via `pending_actions.json`

**Handoff File Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:00:00",
  "meeting_id": "meeting_20251014_120000",
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "action": "Deploy V1.0 to shadow environment",
      "owner": "ops_commander",
      "priority": "high",
      "estimated_duration": "5min",
      "success_criteria": "Model deployed, no errors, smoke tests pass"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "source": "planning_meeting_2"
}
```

**Required Fields:**
- `action`: Complete description (not a fragment!)
- `owner`: Which Executive Team agent executes
- `priority`: high, medium, or low (determines execution order)
- `estimated_duration`: Time estimate
- `success_criteria`: How to verify completion

### Heartbeat
**Periodic synchronization** - Hourly 6-phase cycle for continuous monitoring

### Channels
**Pub-sub messaging** - 8 channels for cross-agent communication

### Smoke Testing
**Validation during meetings** - 3-minute test suites with GO/NO-GO decisions

### File Editing
**Autonomous documentation** - Planning team can edit docs, exec team can edit configs

### Colab Integration
**GPU deployment** - A100 GPU for high-performance testing

---

**Created**: October 12, 2025, 23:45
**Updated**: October 14, 2025
**Version**: 3.0 (Priority Execution Update)
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

---

## 🆕 Latest Updates (October 14, 2025)

### Priority-Based Execution System

**What's New:**
- ✅ **Enhanced Progress Sync** (`enhanced_progress_sync.py`) updated
- ✅ **Priority Grouping**: Actions grouped by HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- ✅ **Complete Action Details**: Owner, duration, success criteria displayed
- ✅ **Execution Order**: HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW enforced
- ✅ **Visual Priority Indicators**: 🔴 HIGH, 🟡 MEDIUM, 🟢 LOW

**How It Works:**

1. **Planning Team Meeting:**
   - Creates actions with priorities
   - Writes `reports/planning/actions_*.json`
   - Writes `reports/handoff/pending_actions.json`

2. **Enhanced Progress Sync:**
   - Reads `pending_actions.json`
   - Groups by priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Formats with complete details

3. **Executive Team Execution:**
   - Reads `execution_progress_update.md`
   - Sees actions grouped by priority
   - Executes HIGH first, then MEDIUM, then LOW

**Example Output:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Next Actions to Execute (By Priority)

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Execute First)
1. Deploy V1.0 to shadow environment
   - Owner: ops_commander
   - Duration: 5min
   - Success Criteria: Model deployed, no errors, smoke tests pass

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Execute After High)
1. Collect baseline metrics
   - Owner: compliance_monitor
   - Duration: 2min
   - Success Criteria: All SLOs measured and logged

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Execute After Medium)
1. Generate deployment report
   - Owner: integration_engineer
   - Duration: 1min
   - Success Criteria: Report includes all metrics
```

**Files Updated:**
- `multi-agent/tools/enhanced_progress_sync.py` (Lines 468-554)
- Complete documentation in `PRIORITY_EXECUTION_SYSTEM_READY.md`

**Benefit:**
- Clear execution order for Executive Team
- No missing information (all details in actions.json)
- Efficient resource allocation (focus on critical tasks first)
