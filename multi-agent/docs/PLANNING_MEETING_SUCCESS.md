## 🎯 Next Steps Recommendation

### Immediate (24h - P0):
1. ✅ Fix evidence integrity issues (precision, rounding)
2. ✅ Land evaluation harness (bootstrap/permutation/τ)
3. ✅ Implement cache keying (versioned + TTL)

### Short-term (1-2 weeks - P1):
4. 🔬 Run 500-query V2 experiment with full ablations
5. ⚡ Profile CoTRR-lite (enforce ≤2× latency)
6. 📊 Build statistical testing framework
7. 🏗️ Design 2-3 baseline multimodal architectures

### Medium-term (1-3 months - P2):
8. 🚀 If V2 passes gates → shadow 5% deployment
9. 📈 Ship V1 Dual-Score weight sweep
10. 🔬 Full multimodal research iteration with new architecture

### Critical Alignment Task:
- **Resolve latency constraint conflict**: Decide on 1.5× vs 2.0× standard
- **Integrate frameworks**: Merge V2's statistical rigor with CoTRR's practical gates

## 🌟 Highlights

**Strongest Agreement**:
- Mistake analysis is valid
- P0 pipeline changes are necessary
- Evidence protocol (file#run_id) is critical
- 500-query validation needed for V2

**Healthy Disagreements**:
- Latency constraints (1.5× vs 2.0×)
- Balance between rigor vs. practicality
- Optimism level (Critic warns against overconfidence)

**Most Actionable Output**:
CoTRR Team (acting as Pre-Architect) provided the most comprehensive execution roadmap with specific experiments, fusion architectures, and concrete milestones.

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Evidence Integrity is Paramount**: All agents agree - no precise numbers without artifact paths
2. **Statistical Rigor + Practical Constraints**: Need to reconcile V2's academic rigor with CoTRR's deployment reality
3. **Data Quality is Foundation**: Multiple agents emphasized data curation, diversity, and bias detection
4. **Multimodal Fusion Requires Exploration**: Need ≥2 alternative architectures with different attention mechanisms
5. **Validation Before Deployment**: 500-query experiments, full ablations, masking sensitivity tests are non-negotiable
