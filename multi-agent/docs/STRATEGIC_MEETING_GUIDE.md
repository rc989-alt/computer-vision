## 🚀 Running the Strategic Analysis Meeting

### Option 1: Quick Run (Recommended)

python3 run_strategic_analysis.py

This will:
- Load all project data automatically
- Run 3-round strategic discussion with 9 AI agents
- Analyze actual experiment results from local files
- Generate prioritized action items
- Create comprehensive reports in `reports/` directory

### Option 2: Custom Meeting

```bash
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent
python3 run_meeting.py "Your specific question here"
```

### Option 3: Test File Access First

```bash
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent
python3 test_file_access.py
```

This verifies that agents can access your research files correctly.

## 🎯 What the Meeting Will Deliver

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
- Diagnosis of V2's multimodal fusion issues
- Root cause analysis of integrity failures
- Evaluation of V1's success factors

### 2. Mistake Analysis
- Why visual features contributed so little
- Why V1/V2 correlation was so high
- Lessons learned for future multimodal projects

### 3. Strategic Recommendations
**SHORT-TERM (2-4 weeks):**
- Decision: Fix V2 vs Pivot vs Hybrid approach
- V1 production optimizations (high ROI)
- Better evaluation frameworks

**MEDIUM-TERM (1-3 months):**
- Next-generation multimodal architecture
- Production pipeline with full guardrails
- Continuous validation systems

**LONG-TERM (3-6 months):**
- True multimodal fusion with proven features
- Candidate generation + reranking
- Data flywheel and personalization

### 4. Prioritized Action Items
- HIGH priority: Immediate actions (24-48h)
- MEDIUM priority: Foundation building (1-2 weeks)
- LOW priority: Long-term improvements

### 5. Decision Framework
Clear criteria for:
- When to fix V2 vs pivot to new approach
- Resource allocation across V1/V2/new research
- Go/no-go thresholds for future experiments

## 🔍 Data Integrity Issues to Discuss

The meeting will address these critical findings:

### Issue 1: Visual Features Underutilized
**Evidence**: `v2_scientific_review_report.json#feature_ablation`
```json
"visual_features": {
  "baseline_score": 0.75,
  "masked_score": 0.7485,
  "performance_drop": 0.0015,  // Only 0.15% drop!
  "suspicious": true
}
```
**Question**: Why does masking visual features barely affect performance?

### Issue 2: High V1/V2 Correlation
**Evidence**: `v2_scientific_review_report.json#score_verification`
```json
"avg_score_correlation": 0.9908  // 99%+ correlation
```
**Question**: Is V2 just doing linear transformation of V1 scores?

### Issue 3: Threshold Failures
**Evidence**: `production_evaluation.json#thresholds_met`
```json
"compliance_improvement": false,  // 13.8% vs 15% target
"ndcg_improvement": false,        // 1.14% vs 8% target
"low_margin": false               // 0.98 vs 0.1 target
```
**Question**: Are our targets too aggressive or is the approach flawed?

## 💡 Key Questions for Agents

The meeting will explore:

1. **Should we fix V2 or pivot?**
   - V2 shows statistical significance but integrity issues
   - Fix might take 2-3 weeks with uncertain outcome
   - Alternative: Start fresh with better architecture

2. **What's the highest ROI next step?**
   - V1 incremental optimization (safe, proven)
   - V2 architectural fixes (risky, potentially high reward)
   - New candidate generation pipeline (different problem)
   - Data quality improvements (foundational)

3. **How to prevent similar issues?**
   - Better evaluation frameworks
   - Earlier integrity checks
   - More rigorous ablation studies
   - Automated validation gates

4. **What's the multimodal roadmap?**
   - Near-term: Practical improvements
   - Medium-term: Proven multimodal fusion
   - Long-term: Full multimodal pipeline with guardrails

## 🎭 How Agents Will Debate

### V1 Production Team (Conservative)
*"V1 is working. Let's optimize what we have rather than chase risky V2 fixes."*

### V2 Scientific Team (Analytical)
*"The integrity issues are real, but the statistical signal is significant. We can fix this with architectural changes."*

### Critic (Skeptical)
*"V2's 0.99 correlation with V1 suggests we're not doing real multimodal fusion. Are we solving the right problem?"*

### Tech Analysis (Technical)
*"The visual feature ablation results point to insufficient fusion. We need cross-modal attention, not simple concatenation."*

### Integrity Guardian (Evidence-focused)
*"All claims must be backed by data. The v2_scientific_review_report.json clearly shows failed integrity checks."*

### Moderator (Synthesizer)
*"Consensus: V1 is solid, V2 needs fixes. Question: Is fixing V2 the best use of resources vs starting fresh?"*

### If API keys are missing:
Check: `research/api_keys.env`
Should contain:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

### If meeting crashes:
Check logs in: `multi-agent/strategic_meeting_with_data.log`
