## 🎯 Option 1: Automatic Planning Team Meeting (Recommended)

### **Run the autonomous coordinator:**

```bash
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent
python autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py
```

### **What it will do:**
1. Detects that Cycle 1 is complete
2. Shows execution summary (7/7 tasks completed)
3. **Asks for manual checkpoint approval**
4. Runs Planning Team review meeting
5. Generates new `pending_actions.json` for Cycle 2
6. Ready for next Colab execution

### **Expected flow:**

```
🔄 CYCLE 1 STATUS
================================================================================
✅ Cycle 1 complete
📊 Results: 7/7 tasks completed
📄 Progress report: .../execution_progress_update.md

⏸️ MANUAL CHECKPOINT
Approve results and continue to Planning Team meeting? (yes/no): yes

📋 TRIGGER PLANNING TEAM MEETING

## 🎯 Option 2: Manual Planning Team Review

### **Run the planning review script directly:**

```bash
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent
python scripts/run_planning_review_meeting.py
```

### **What it will do:**
1. Reads `execution_progress_update.md`
2. Reads `execution_results_20251014_234612.json`
3. Prepares Planning Team meeting topic
4. **TODO:** Actually runs Planning Team (currently just prepares the topic)

### **Current behavior:**
- Saves planning meeting topic to: `reports/planning/review_meeting_topic.md`
- You then need to trigger the Planning Team manually

**Note:** This is a simplified version. Use Option 1 (autonomous coordinator) for full automation.

## 📋 What Planning Team Will Do

### **Planning Team composition (4 agents):**
1. **Strategic Leader (Opus 4)** - Makes GO/PAUSE/PIVOT decisions
2. **Empirical Validation Lead (Sonnet 4)** - Validates statistical rigor
3. **Critical Evaluator (GPT-4)** - Challenges claims and methodology
4. **Gemini Research Advisor (Gemini Flash)** - Provides literature context

### **Their review process:**

**Step 1: Analyze Cycle 1 Results**
- Review all 7 task completions
- Analyze CLIP diagnostic findings (MCS = 0.73, p < 0.001)
- Assess ALIGN blocker and mitigation strategy
- Evaluate paper outline positioning

**Step 2: Assess Progress Toward Week 1 Goals**
```
Week 1 GO/NO-GO Criteria:
├── Diagnostic tools work on ≥3 models → ✅ 1/3 complete (CLIP done)
├── Statistical evidence (p<0.05) → ✅ ACHIEVED (p < 0.001)
├── CLIP diagnostic completed → ✅ COMPLETED
├── ALIGN diagnostic attempted → ⚠️ BLOCKED (BLIP alternative ready)
└── Results logged to MLflow → ✅ ACTIVE

Status: ON TRACK (need 2 more models by Oct 20)
```

**Step 3: Identify Next Priorities**

Based on Cycle 1 results:

**If CLIP showed collapse (✅ CONFIRMED):**
- HIGH: Run BLIP diagnostic to confirm pattern
- HIGH: Run Flamingo/LLaVA diagnostic for cross-architecture validation
- MEDIUM: Cross-model statistical comparison
- MEDIUM: Update paper with Cycle 1 results

**If CLIP showed no collapse (❌ Not the case):**
- Would need to investigate V2-specific issue
- Adjust paper positioning

**Step 4: Generate New `pending_actions.json`**

Planning Team will create tasks for Cycle 2, such as:

```json
{
  "meeting_id": "cvpr_planning_cycle2_20251014",
  "generated_at": "2025-10-14T23:50:00Z",
  "context": "Week 1 Cycle 2: CLIP validated attention collapse, expanding to BLIP/Flamingo",
  "decisions": [
    {
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "action": "Run BLIP diagnostic experiment with same protocol as CLIP",
      "owner": "ops_commander",
      "rationale": "CLIP showed MCS=0.73 (p<0.001). Need second model for cross-validation.",
      "deadline": "2025-10-16T18:00:00Z",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "BLIP attention weights extracted successfully",
        "MCS computed with CI95",
        "Statistical comparison to CLIP baseline",
        "Results logged to MLflow"
      ]
    },
    {
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "action": "Run Flamingo diagnostic experiment",
      "owner": "ops_commander",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 How to Execute Cycle 2 (After Planning Team Completes)

### **Once new `pending_actions.json` is generated:**

**Option A: Via Autonomous Coordinator**
```bash
# Continue from where coordinator left off
# It will automatically detect new pending_actions.json
# and prompt you to run Colab execution
```

**Option B: Directly in Colab**
```
1. Open: research/colab/cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb
2. Run all cells
3. Notebook will read new pending_actions.json
4. Execute new tasks (e.g., BLIP diagnostic)
5. Results saved to execution_progress_update.md
6. Return to coordinator for Cycle 3 planning
```

## 📊 Expected Timeline

### **Cycle 2 (BLIP + Flamingo diagnostics):**
- Planning Team review: ~5-10 minutes (4 agents discussing)
- Generate new pending_actions.json: ~2 minutes
- Executive Team execution (Colab): ~10-15 minutes (2 model diagnostics)
- Total Cycle 2: ~20-30 minutes

### **Cycle 3 (Cross-model analysis):**
- Planning Team review: ~5 minutes
- Statistical comparison: ~5 minutes
- Paper update: ~10 minutes
- Total Cycle 3: ~20 minutes

### **Week 1 GO/NO-GO Decision:**
- After Cycle 2 or 3 (depending on results)
- Planning Team makes final GO/PIVOT/DIAGNOSTIC decision
- Target: October 20, 2025 (6 days remaining)

## 🔍 How to Find Results for Different Runs

### **The pattern:**

Every Colab execution creates timestamped files:

```
reports/execution/results/execution_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
reports/execution/summaries/execution_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
reports/execution/results/execution_dashboard_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png
```

### **For Cycle 1 (just completed):**
- Timestamp: `20251014_234612`
- Files:
  - `execution_results_20251014_234612.json`
  - `execution_summary_20251014_234612.md`
  - `execution_dashboard_20251014_234612.png`

### **For Cycle 2 (next run):**
- Timestamp: Will be `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` when it runs
- Files will be created automatically with new timestamp

### **To find latest results:**

```bash
# List all execution results sorted by time
ls -lt /path/to/reports/execution/results/

# Read most recent summary
cat /path/to/reports/execution/summaries/execution_summary_*.md | tail -n +1

# Or use the main handoff file (always latest)
cat /path/to/reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md
```

### **Planning Team always reads:**
1. `reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md` - Main summary (always latest)
2. `reports/execution/results/execution_results_*.json` - Most recent JSON
3. `CYCLE1_EXECUTIVE_TEAM_ANALYSIS.md` - Strategic analysis

**Note:** The handoff file (`execution_progress_update.md`) is always overwritten with latest results, so Planning Team just reads that file directly.
