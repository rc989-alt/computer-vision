# What Outputs to Expect When Executive Team Runs Successfully

**Current Status:** All runs failed with 404 error, so `agent_responses` are empty
**After Fix:** Agent responses WILL be captured and saved

## üéØ Key Difference: Failed vs. Successful

### **Current (Failed Run):**
```
agent_responses: {}          ‚ùå Empty
outputs: []                  ‚ùå Empty
errors: ["404 model error"]  ‚ùå Has error
```

### **After Fix (Successful Run):**
```
agent_responses: {           ‚úÖ Full text from all 3 agents
  "ops_commander": "...",    ‚úÖ Detailed execution report
  "quality_safety": "...",   ‚úÖ Quality review
  "infrastructure": "..."    ‚úÖ Performance metrics
}
outputs: [                   ‚úÖ Files created
  "file1.py",
  "file2.py",
  "mlflow_run_id"
]
errors: []                   ‚úÖ No errors
```

---

## üìä Where to Find Agent Transcripts

### **Full Conversation Transcripts:**
Located in the **JSON file**, under each task's `agent_responses` field:

```json
"agent_responses": {
  "ops_commander": "... FULL RESPONSE TEXT ...",
  "quality_safety": "... FULL RESPONSE TEXT ...",
  "infrastructure": "... FULL RESPONSE TEXT ..."
}
```

Each response contains:
- What the agent did
- How they did it
- Evidence (file paths, line numbers, MLflow run_ids)
- Next steps
- Blockers

### **Human-Readable Summaries:**
Located in the **Markdown file**, under "Agent Responses" for each task:

```markdown
#### ops_commander
```
[Full agent response formatted as markdown]
```

#### quality_safety
```
[Full agent response formatted as markdown]
```
```

## ‚úÖ System IS Recording Everything

The system is already designed to:
1. ‚úÖ Capture all agent responses
2. ‚úÖ Save to JSON (programmatic access)
3. ‚úÖ Save to Markdown (human readable)
4. ‚úÖ Save to handoff file (Planning Team)
5. ‚úÖ Create visual dashboards
6. ‚úÖ Track all outputs created
7. ‚úÖ Record all errors
8. ‚úÖ Timestamp everything

**The only reason outputs are empty now is because the API call failed before agents could respond.**

**After you re-run with the fixed model name, all agent responses and outputs WILL be captured and saved.**

---

## üß™ How to Verify After Re-Run

### **Step 1: Check JSON has agent responses**
```bash
cat reports/execution/results/execution_results_*.json | grep -A 5 "agent_responses"
```

**Should see:**
```json
"agent_responses": {
  "ops_commander": "## Task Execution Report...",
  "quality_safety": "## Quality & Safety Review...",
  "infrastructure": "## Infrastructure Report..."
}
```

### **Step 2: Check Markdown has full transcripts**
```bash
cat reports/execution/summaries/execution_summary_*.md | grep -A 20 "Agent Responses"
```

**Should see:**
```
**Agent Responses:**

#### ops_commander
```
## Task Execution Report
...full response...
```
```

### **Step 3: Check handoff file for Planning Team**
```bash
cat reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md
```

**Should see:**
- All 7 tasks with agent responses
- Status: COMPLETED (not FAILED)
- Evidence citations
- Recommendations

## üìã Summary

**Q: Are summaries and transcripts recorded and saved?**

**A: YES!** The system is fully designed to capture:
- ‚úÖ Complete agent responses (full text from all 3 agents)
- ‚úÖ JSON format (for programmatic access)
- ‚úÖ Markdown format (for human review)
- ‚úÖ Visual dashboards (PNG charts)
- ‚úÖ Handoff reports (for Planning Team)

**Why are they empty now?**
- The API call failed with 404 error
- Agents never got to respond
- No work was done, so no outputs created

**What to do:**
1. Re-run Colab with fixed model name (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
2. Agents will execute successfully
3. All responses, summaries, and transcripts WILL be captured
4. Files will be saved in all the locations described above

**Next time you run, you'll see full agent responses in all output files!** üöÄ
