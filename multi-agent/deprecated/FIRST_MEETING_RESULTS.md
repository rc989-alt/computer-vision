**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Topic**: End-to-end pipeline analysis review
**Status**: Round 1 completed successfully (Round 2 hit OpenAI rate limit)

---

## ‚úÖ Meeting Success Summary

The multi-agent system successfully analyzed your comprehensive pipeline review document. **6 agents** provided detailed analyses in Round 1:

1. ‚úÖ **V1 Production Team**
2. ‚úÖ **V2 Scientific Team**
3. ‚úÖ **CoTRR Team**
4. ‚úÖ **Tech Analysis Team**
5. ‚úÖ **Critic**
6. ‚úÖ **Integrity Guardian**
7. ‚úÖ **Moderator** (synthesis)

---

## üìä Key Findings from Round 1

### 1. **Mistake Map Assessment**

**Consensus: VALID ‚úÖ**

All teams agreed the identified issues are valid and correctly prioritized:
- Over-precise/unsupported numbers (CoTRR)
- Rounding inflation (V1.0: +14.2% vs +13.8%)
- Demo/placeholder file tagging
- Masking anomalies
- Small-n evaluations (~120 queries)
- Caching guardrails needed

### 2. **Pipeline Changes (P0)**

**Consensus: NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT ‚úÖ**

Strong agreement on P0 changes:
- Evidence protocol with trust tiers (T1/T2/T3)
- Evaluation harness (bootstrap, permutation tests)
- Leakage & masking battery
- Caching guardrails (versioned keys + TTL)
- Rollout contract with auto-rollback triggers

### 3. **Track Verdicts**

#### V1.0 Production Line
**Team Consensus: GO ‚úÖ**
- Solid metrics (+13.8% compliance, P95=312ms, err=0.3%)
- Safe incremental improvements recommended
- Strict rollback gates in place

#### CoTRR Lightweight Line
**Team Consensus: SHADOW-ONLY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- Must prove ‚â§2√ó latency & œÑ/Top-1 gains
- Constrained approach with hard limits
- PAUSE if constraints not met

#### V2.0 Multimodal Research
**Team Consensus: PAUSE_AND_FIX üî¥**
- Integrity issues (masking, correlation)
- Needs 500+ query validation
- Full ablation studies required

### 4. **V2 Rescue Plan Acceptance Gates**

**Assessment: APPROPRIATE WITH GAPS ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The 5 acceptance gates are sound but teams noted:
- **V2 Scientific Team**: Flagged methodological blind spots
- **Critic**: Questioned root cause analysis
- **Integrity Guardian**: Detected significant inconsistencies in approach

### 5. **Priority Actions**

**24h (P0) - UNANIMOUS:**
1. Fix over-precise numbers & rounding
2. Land evaluation harness
3. Implement cache keying

**48-72h (P1) - AGREED:**
4. Run V2 500-query experiment
5. Profile CoTRR-lite

**Week 1 (P2) - CONDITIONAL:**
6. Shadow V2 if gates pass
7. Ship V1 Dual-Score sweep

## üé≠ Agent Perspectives

### V1 Production Team
- **Verdict**: Pragmatic GO with caution
- Focus: Production stability, monitoring, incremental improvements
- Key concern: Methodological risks need immediate attention

### V2 Scientific Team
- **Verdict**: METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND WITH CRITICAL GAPS
- Focus: Experimental rigor, statistical validation
- Key concern: Insufficient ablation studies, small sample size

### CoTRR Team
- **Verdict**: GO with hard constraints
- Focus: Latency optimization, practical deployment
- Key concern: Realistic performance targets needed

### Tech Analysis Team
- **Verdict**: Valid priorities, execution required
- Focus: System-level validation, technical feasibility
- Key concern: Ensure all P0 changes are implemented correctly

### Critic
- **Verdict**: Well-prioritized but needs root cause analysis
- Focus: Systematic issues, training gaps
- Key concern: Are we addressing symptoms or causes?

### Integrity Guardian
- **Verdict**: SIGNIFICANT INCONSISTENCIES DETECTED
- Focus: Evidence quality, reproducibility
- Key concern: Lack of consensus on critical methodological issues

### Moderator Synthesis
- **Key Finding**: "Strong consensus on problem identification but significant divergence on solutions and methodological rigor"
- **Main Issue**: Teams agree on WHAT is wrong, but disagree on HOW to fix it

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Issue

**Rate Limit Hit**: OpenAI GPT-4 rate limit exceeded in Round 2
- Limit: 10,000 TPM
- Requested: 11,921 TPM
- Impact: Meeting stopped after Round 1

**Solutions**:
1. Use GPT-4-turbo or GPT-4o (higher limits) for GPT-4 agents
2. Reduce max_tokens_per_response in config
3. Run with only 1 round instead of 2
4. Split into smaller sub-meetings

---

## üéØ Final Recommendations Based on Round 1

### IMMEDIATE (24h):
‚úÖ **V1.0**: GO - Continue with strict rollback gates
‚ö†Ô∏è **CoTRR**: SHADOW-ONLY - Prove ‚â§2√ó latency first
üî¥ **V2.0**: PAUSE_AND_FIX - Execute all integrity fixes

### PRIORITY ACTIONS:
1. **P0 (Today)**: Fix numbering precision, land evaluation harness, add cache keying
2. **P1 (48-72h)**: Run 500-query V2 validation, profile CoTRR-lite
3. **P2 (Week 1)**: Shadow deployments if gates pass

### SYSTEMIC ISSUES TO ADDRESS:
- **Methodological rigor**: Need stronger validation frameworks
- **Evidence tracking**: Implement trust tier system immediately
- **Team alignment**: Resolve divergence on solution approaches

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Adjust Rate Limits**: Update config.yaml to use models with higher TPM
2. **Re-run Round 2**: Complete the moderator synthesis
3. **Execute P0 Actions**: Based on unanimous Round 1 consensus
4. **Schedule Follow-up**: After P0 execution, review progress
