## üìä Week 1 GO/NO-GO Decision Criteria

**Date:** October 20, 2025 (7 days from now)

### **Decision Thresholds:**

| Metric | Threshold | Outcome |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Models tested** | ‚â•3 | Minimum for field-wide claim |
| **Models with collapse** | ‚â•2 | GO signal (field-wide paper) |
| **Statistical significance** | p<0.05 | Required for all claims |
| **Attention imbalance** | >80% | Defines "severe collapse" |

### **Three Paper Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Full Success (GO Signal)**
- **Condition:** ‚â•2 external models show >80% imbalance (p<0.05)
- **Paper Scope:** Universal diagnostic framework + solutions
- **Acceptance Probability:** 72%

**Scenario 2: Partial Success (PIVOT)**
- **Condition:** Only V2 shows severe collapse
- **Paper Scope:** Deep case study + diagnostic toolkit
- **Acceptance Probability:** 65%

**Scenario 3: Diagnostic Success (RECOMMENDED)** ‚≠ê
- **Condition:** Tools work on all models (regardless of findings)
- **Paper Scope:** Diagnostic framework contribution
- **Acceptance Probability:** 85%
