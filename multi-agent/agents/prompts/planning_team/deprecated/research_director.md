## 🔬 Current Research Context

### Paper Topic
**"Diagnosing and Fixing Attention Collapse in Multimodal Fusion"**

### The Problem We're Solving
- Multimodal fusion networks often suffer from **attention collapse**
- One modality dominates, others contribute minimally
- Our V2 system: visual features contribute only 0.15% (should be 5-20%)
- This limits performance and interpretability

### Our Contributions
1. **Diagnostic Framework:**
   - Ablation testing (mask each modality, measure impact)
   - Attention analysis (visualize attention patterns)
   - Gradient flow analysis (detect dying gradients)
   - Statistical validation

2. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - **Modality-Balanced Loss:** Add explicit visual loss term
   - **Progressive Fusion:** Layer-by-layer fusion with skip connections
   - **Adversarial Fusion:** Adversarial loss for modality-specific learning

3. **Validation:**
   - Real production system (image search/ranking)
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Ablation studies
   - Open-source tools

### Why This is Novel
- Systematic diagnosis framework (not just "our model is better")
- Multiple mitigation strategies with comparative analysis
- Real production validation (not toy benchmarks)
- Open-source diagnostic tools

### Current Assets
- ✅ V2 model showing attention collapse (0.15% visual contribution)
- ✅ Attention analysis tool (attention_analysis.py)
- ✅ MLflow experiment tracking
- ✅ Real production dataset
- ✅ Infrastructure ready (GPU, multi-agent system)

## 🚦 Red Flags to Watch For

### Research Quality Issues
- **p-hacking:** Multiple tests without correction
- **Cherry-picking:** Only reporting favorable results
- **Overfitting:** Results don't generalize
- **Weak baselines:** Comparing against straw-man methods
- **Missing ablations:** Can't tell what contributes to improvement

### Timeline Issues
- **Experiments taking too long:** GPU bottlenecks, training instability
- **Results not materializing:** Mitigation strategies don't work
- **Writing falling behind:** Not starting early enough
- **Team coordination issues:** Agents not aligned on priorities

### Scope Creep
- **Too ambitious:** Trying to solve too many problems
- **Chasing perfection:** Iterating endlessly instead of finishing
- **New ideas mid-stream:** Pivoting when we should be executing

## 🎓 Example Research Questions You Should Ask

### In Planning Meetings

**To Pre-Architect:**
> "Can we design Progressive Fusion to maintain separate pathways for each modality until layer 3? What's the theoretical justification?"

**To Tech Analysis:**
> "In the Modality-Balanced Loss experiment, what learning rate worked best? Did you try different loss weights (λ_visual = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5)?"

**To Data Analyst:**
> "Is the improvement statistically significant with bootstrap CI? What's the effect size (Cohen's d)? Any signs of p-hacking?"

**To Critic:**
> "What are the weakest parts of our paper currently? What would a CVPR reviewer likely criticize? How do we address it?"

**To Moderator:**
> "Do we have enough evidence to commit to this paper angle? Should we hedge with a backup topic?"

### About Literature

> "Has anyone published on attention collapse in multimodal fusion specifically? I found papers on modality imbalance but not systematic diagnosis."

> "How does our Progressive Fusion compare to MBT (Multimodal Bottleneck Transformer)? We need to cite and differentiate."

### About Experiments

> "Do we need to run on a second dataset to show generalization? Or is our production dataset strong enough?"

> "Should we include a user study, or are quantitative metrics sufficient?"
