# Error Fixed - System Ready to Re-Run

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND READY
**Issue:** All 7 tasks failed with model name error

---

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

You ran the Colab notebook and all 7 tasks failed immediately with:

```
Error code: 404 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'not_found_error', 'message': 'model: claude-sonnet-4'}}
```

**Result:** 0/7 tasks completed, 7/7 failed in <1 second each

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Incorrect Anthropic model name
- ❌ Used: `claude-sonnet-4`
- ✅ Fixed to: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`

**File Updated:** `research/colab/cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb`
**Cell Modified:** Cell 8 (Executive Team configuration)
**Changes:** Updated all 3 agents (ops_commander, quality_safety, infrastructure)

---

## 🔄 Ready to Re-Run

The system is now fixed and ready to re-run. Here's what to do:

### **Option 1: Re-Run in Colab (Recommended)**

1. **Open the updated notebook:**
   - Go to Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
   - Navigate to `MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/research/colab/`
   - Open `cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb`

2. **Run all cells:**
   - Click "Runtime" → "Run all"
   - Or run cells sequentially (Shift+Enter)

3. **What should happen now:**
   ```
   ✅ Google Drive mounted
   ✅ API keys loaded successfully (3/3 keys found)
   ✅ Executive Team initialized (3 agents)
   🚀 Starting Task task_1... (should work this time!)
   📝 Response from ops_commander: [Detailed response]
   ✅ Task completed in X seconds
   ```

4. **Expected outcome:**
   - All 7 tasks should execute
   - Agents will provide detailed responses
   - Tasks will show progress toward Week 1 goals
   - Results saved to `execution_progress_update.md`

### **Option 2: Run via Autonomous Coordinator**

1. **Start the coordinator:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent
   python autonomous_cycle_coordinator.py
   ```

2. **Select option 1:** Run single cycle

3. **Follow prompts:**
   - Open Colab when prompted
   - Run the fixed notebook
   - Return to coordinator when complete
   - Review results at manual checkpoint

## 📋 What's Been Fixed

### **1. Model Name Error (This Issue)**
- ✅ Updated `claude-sonnet-4` → `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- ✅ All 3 Executive Team agents fixed
- ✅ Synced to Google Drive

### **2. API Key Loading (Previously Fixed)**
- ✅ Smart search finds .env file
- ✅ Strips quotes from values
- ✅ Verifies all 3 required keys

### **3. Planning Team Review (Previously Added)**
- ✅ After manual checkpoint, Planning Team reviews results
- ✅ Generates new `pending_actions.json` for next cycle
- ✅ Evidence-based planning

## 🧪 Quick Test

Before running all 7 tasks, you can test if the fix worked:

**Add this test cell in Colab (after Cell 8):**

```python
# Quick test: Check if agents can initialize
print("🧪 Testing API connections...")

test_context = "Please confirm you're ready to execute tasks."

for agent_name, agent in executive_team_agents.items():
    try:
        response = agent.respond(test_context)
        print(f"✅ {agent_name}: API working ({len(response)} chars)")
        print(f"   Preview: {response[:100]}...")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ {agent_name}: {e}")
        raise

print("\n✅ All agents working! Ready for task execution.")
```

**Expected output:**
```
🧪 Testing API connections...
✅ ops_commander: API working (245 chars)
   Preview: I'm ready to execute tasks for the CVPR 2025 research mission. I have access to...
✅ quality_safety: API working (198 chars)
   Preview: Confirmed. I'm prepared to ensure code quality and reproducibility for all...
✅ infrastructure: API working (223 chars)
   Preview: Infrastructure monitoring systems ready. I can track performance and...

✅ All agents working! Ready for task execution.
```

## 🚨 If You Still Get Errors

### **Error: API Key Not Found**
- Check `ENV_FILE_PATH_FIX.md` for solution
- Try Colab Secrets as alternative (see User Guide)

### **Error: Different Model Not Found**
- Verify your API keys are valid
- Check model names in Cell 8:
  - Anthropic: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
  - OpenAI: `gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09` or latest
  - Google: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` or latest

### **Error: Import Errors**
- Make sure Cell 4 (dependencies) ran successfully
- Check that Google Drive is mounted (Cell 2)

### **Error: File Not Found (pending_actions.json)**
- File exists at: `multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json`
- Already synced to Google Drive
- Should auto-detect when notebook runs
