# CVPR 2025 Week 1 GO/NO-GO Decision Report

**Decision Date:** 2025-10-22  
**Project:** Attention Collapse Diagnostics in Vision-Language Models  
**Phase:** Week 1 Validation & Baseline Establishment

## Executive Summary

### üéØ **DECISION: NO-GO**  
### üìä **CONFIDENCE LEVEL: VERY LOW**

The refreshed Week‚ÄØ1 analysis (MLflow run `83adf8046b784dc7a41add2d8a6b90ba`) produced **no measurable difference** between simple and complex query conditions. Both entropy and dispersion traces are numerically identical and the statistical tests return `NaN`, indicating that the current pipeline captured constant values rather than meaningful attention measurements. Until we resolve the data quality issue, the Week‚ÄØ1 baseline does **not** justify moving to mitigation work.

## Section 1: Experimental Setup

- **Model:** `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`
- **Device:** CPU (local run)
- **Attention Extraction:** `attn_implementation="eager"`, `output_attentions=True`
- **Queries:** 10 simple vs 10 complex prompts (identical set used in prior runs)
- **Image Source:** Local Pexels sample fetched via Phase‚ÄØ0 helper after API key configuration
- **Artifacts:**  
  - `multi-agent/results/week1/statistical_analysis.md`  
  - `multi-agent/results/week1/hypothesis_tests.json`  
  - `multi-agent/results/week1/effect_sizes.csv`

## Section 2: Quantitative Findings

| Metric | Simple Mean | Complex Mean | Reduction | Test | p-value | Effect Size |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| Entropy | 3.8314 | 3.8314 | 0.0000 | Paired t-test | `NaN` | 0.0000 (small) |
| Dispersion | 224.3320 | 224.3320 | 0.0000 | Paired t-test | `NaN` | 0.0000 (small) |

- Statistical tests (`hypothesis_tests.json`) are returning `NaN` statistics because each paired sample is identical.  
- Effect sizes calculated in `effect_sizes.csv` are 0.0, reinforcing that no variance was observed.
- MLflow logs confirm the run completed, but entropy/dispersion tensors appear to have collapsed to constant values.

## Section 3: Interpretation

1. **Data Integrity Issue:** The identical means suggest our sampling loop is reusing the same attention tensor instead of recomputing per prompt/image pair. This can happen if inputs are not moved to the correct device or the processor call is accidentally cached.
2. **Statistical Inconclusiveness:** Because all observations are constant, standard tests yield `NaN`, so the previous NO-GO with ‚Äúmedium effect‚Äù is no longer defensible.
3. **System Pipeline Risk:** The absence of variance implies the CLIP extraction patch is still unstable when run outside Colab (local CPU path). Before drawing research conclusions, we must re-establish baseline parity across environments.

## Section 4: Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Before Week 2)
1. **Re-run W1-004 / W1-006 with verified inputs**  
   - Ensure `processor(..., images=...)` receives unique images.  
   - Inspect raw attention tensors for variability across prompts.
2. **Add Unit Checks**  
   - Assert that entropy vectors exhibit non-zero variance before logging results.  
   - Fail fast if `NaN` or constant tensors are detected.
3. **Document the Environment Gap**  
   - Capture the difference between Colab GPU and local CPU runs (device, precision, attention extraction order).

### Research Path
- Hold off on mitigation techniques until a statistically sound baseline is reproduced.
- Once variance is restored, rerun the full statistical pipeline and regenerate this GO/NO-GO report.

## Conclusion

**Final Recommendation:** **NO-GO (VERY LOW confidence)**  
Week‚ÄØ1 data, as currently captured, does **not** demonstrate attention collapse. The experimental set must be repaired and repeated before we advance to mitigation or publication track work.
