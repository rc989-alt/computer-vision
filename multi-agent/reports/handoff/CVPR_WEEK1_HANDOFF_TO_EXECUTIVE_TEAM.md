# CVPR 2025 Week 1 - Handoff to Executive Team

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**From:** Planning Team
**To:** Executive Team (Ops Commander, Quality & Safety Officer, Infrastructure & Performance Monitor)
**Subject:** Week 1 Cross-Architecture Validation Tasks for CVPR 2025 Paper

---

## 📋 Mission Context

The Planning Team has reviewed the CVPR 2025 research mission and assigned Week 1 validation tasks. Our goal is to determine if attention collapse (0.15% visual contribution in our V2 model) is a **field-wide phenomenon** or specific to our architecture.

### **Research Goal**
Submit CVPR 2025 paper: **"Diagnosing and Preventing Attention Collapse in Multimodal Fusion"**

### **Timeline**
- **Abstract Deadline:** November 6, 2025 (23 days)
- **Full Paper Deadline:** November 13, 2025 (30 days)
- **Week 1 GO/NO-GO Decision:** October 20, 2025 (7 days)

### **Week 1 Hypothesis**
Attention collapse may be widespread across multimodal architectures (CLIP, ALIGN, Flamingo). Testing this hypothesis determines our paper scope:
- **GO Signal:** ≥2 external models show >80% attention imbalance (p<0.05) → Field-wide paper
- **Pivot Signal:** Only V2 shows collapse → Focused case study paper
- **Diagnostic Success:** Tools work on all models → Framework contribution guaranteed

**Status:** 🔴 Blocked by Tasks 1 & 2
**Dependencies:** Task 1 (adapt attention_analysis.py), Task 2 (CLIP environment)

**Objective:**
First validation datapoint: Does CLIP show attention collapse?

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ Visualization plots generated (layer-wise attention patterns)
- ✅ Initial findings documented in markdown report

**Deliverables:**
- CLIP diagnostic results (MCS, attention patterns)
- MLflow run_id for experiment
- Markdown report: `reports/execution/results/clip_diagnostic_results.md`
- Visualization plots saved to `reports/execution/results/clip_attention_plots/`

## 📊 Acceptance Gates for Week 1

The Week 1 GO/NO-GO decision (Oct 20) depends on these thresholds:

| Metric | Threshold | Decision |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Models tested** | ≥3 | Minimum for field-wide claim |
| **Models with collapse** | ≥2 | GO signal (field-wide paper) |
| **Statistical significance** | p<0.05 | Required for all claims |
| **Attention imbalance** | >80% | Defines "severe collapse" |

### **Decision Paths:**
1. **GO (Field-wide):** ≥2 models show >80% imbalance (p<0.05)
   - **Paper Scope:** Universal diagnostic framework + solutions
   - **Acceptance Probability:** 72%

2. **PIVOT (Focused):** Only V2 shows severe collapse
   - **Paper Scope:** Deep case study + diagnostic toolkit
   - **Acceptance Probability:** 65%

3. **DIAGNOSTIC SUCCESS:** Tools work on all models (regardless of findings)
   - **Paper Scope:** Diagnostic framework contribution
   - **Acceptance Probability:** 85% ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**

✅ **DO:** Investigate if this is a broader phenomenon
✅ **DO:** Create diagnostic tools that work across architectures
✅ **DO:** Contribute insights for the entire research community

### **Quality Standards:**
- **Statistical Rigor:** All claims backed by CI95, p-values
- **Reproducibility:** MLflow tracking for all experiments
- **Visualization:** Clear plots for attention patterns
- **Documentation:** Usage examples for diagnostic tools
