#### `pending_actions.json` (Planning → Executive)
Planning Team's output for Executive Team to execute.

**Schema:**
```json
{

      "priority": "HIGH",
      "action": "Run baseline attention analysis experiment",
      "owner": "ops_commander",
      "deadline": "2025-10-15T18:00:00Z",
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        "Visual ablation drop measured",
        "CI95 computed",
        "Results logged to MLflow"
      ],
      "evidence_paths": []
    }
  ],
  "acceptance_gates": {
    "visual_ablation_drop": "≥ 5%",
    "v1_v2_corr": "< 0.95",
    "ndcg@10": "≥ 0.72"
  },
  "verdict": "GO"
}
```

#### `execution_progress_update.md` (Executive → Planning)
Executive Team's report back to Planning Team.

**Format:**
```markdown
# Execution Progress Update

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Meeting ID:** execution_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
**Reporting Agent:** Ops Commander

## Completed Actions
- [x] Action 1 (HIGH priority)
  - Result: Success
  - Evidence: `path/to/artifact`
  - MLflow run_id: `abc123`

## In Progress Actions
- [ ] Action 2 (MEDIUM priority)
  - Status: 60% complete
  - Expected completion: 2025-10-15

## Blocked Actions
- [ ] Action 3 (LOW priority)
  - Blocker: Missing dataset
  - Resolution plan: ...

## Metrics Report
- Compliance@1: 0.85 (Δ = +13%)
- nDCG@10: 0.73 (Δ = +1.14%)
- Latency P95: 42ms ✅

## Recommendations
Planning Team should review for next steps.
```

**Critical:** Both files are version-controlled and timestamped to enable audit trail.

### Integrity Reports

**Location:** `integrity/`

**Files:** `integrity_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

**Content:**
- Provenance verification results
- Compliance certification
- Data integrity checks
- Integrity Score (0-100)

**Generated by:** Critical Evaluator & Integrity Guardian during Planning Team meetings

---

### Progress Tracking

**Location:** `progress/`

**Files:**
- `progress_update.json` - Machine-readable progress
- `progress_update.md` - Human-readable summary

**Content:**
- Overall system progress
- Milestone tracking
- Deployment stage status
- SLO status

**Updated by:** `autonomous_coordinator.py` during heartbeat cycles

---

### Documentation

**Location:** `documentation/`

**Long-term strategic documents:**
- `COTRR_BENCHMARK_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `STRATEGIC_MEETING_FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md`
- Other high-level analyses

**Persistent across meetings** (not deleted during cleanup)

---

### Archive

**Location:** `archive/`

**Purpose:** Store old reports after cleanup

**Retention Policy:**
- Reports older than 30 days moved to archive
- Archive cleaned every 90 days
- Critical documents moved to `documentation/` before archiving

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Timestamps
All timestamped files use format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

Example: `transcript_20251014_173045.md` = October 14, 2025, 5:30:45 PM

### Meeting IDs
Format: `{team}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}`

Examples:
- `planning_20251014_173045`
- `execution_20251014_180000`

### File Extensions
- `.md` - Markdown (human-readable reports)
- `.json` - Structured data (machine-readable)
- `.log` - System logs

---

## Usage Examples

### After Planning Team Meeting
```bash
# Check what actions were created
cat reports/handoff/pending_actions.json

# Read the meeting summary
cat reports/planning/summaries/summary_20251014_173045.md

# View full transcript
cat reports/planning/transcripts/transcript_20251014_173045.md
```

### After Executive Team Meeting
```bash
# Check execution progress
cat reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md

# View experiment results
cat reports/execution/results/results_20251014_180000.json

# Check latest metrics
cat reports/progress/progress_update.json
```

### Finding Latest Reports
```bash
# Latest planning meeting
ls -t reports/planning/summaries/ | head -1

# Latest execution meeting
ls -t reports/execution/summaries/ | head -1

# Latest handoff files
ls -t reports/handoff/
```

## Integration with Autonomous System

### Report Generation Flow

1. **Planning Team Meeting**
   - Generates: `transcript`, `summary`, `actions.json`
   - Writes: `handoff/pending_actions.json`
   - Updates: `progress/progress_update.*`

2. **Executive Team Reads Handoff**
   - Reads: `handoff/pending_actions.json`
   - Executes actions by priority (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)

3. **Executive Team Meeting**
   - Generates: `transcript`, `summary`, `results.json`
   - Writes: `handoff/execution_progress_update.md`
   - Updates: `progress/progress_update.*`

4. **Planning Team Reviews Progress**
   - Reads: `handoff/execution_progress_update.md`
   - Decides next steps based on results

### Cleanup
Old reports (>30 days) automatically moved to `archive/` during heartbeat cycles.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Missing handoff files
**Problem:** `pending_actions.json` or `execution_progress_update.md` not found

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Planning Team meeting completed
ls -la reports/planning/summaries/

# Verify handoff directory exists
ls -la reports/handoff/

# Run Planning Team meeting to generate pending_actions.json
python scripts/run_planning_meeting.py
```

### Reports in wrong directory
**Problem:** Reports generated at root level instead of subdirectories

**Solution:** Update report generation paths in code:
```python
# In autonomous_coordinator.py or run_*.py
REPORTS_DIR = Path("reports")
PLANNING_DIR = REPORTS_DIR / "planning"
EXECUTION_DIR = REPORTS_DIR / "execution"
```
