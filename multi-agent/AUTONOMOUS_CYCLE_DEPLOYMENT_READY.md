## 🚀 Quick Start (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Open Google Colab**

```
https://colab.research.google.com/
```

### **Step 2: Upload Notebook**

**From Google Drive:**
```
MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/research/colab/cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb
```

**Or upload from local:**
- Download from: `research/colab/cvpr_autonomous_execution_cycle.ipynb`
- Upload to Colab

### **Step 3: Select GPU Runtime**

```
Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (A100 recommended)
```

### **Step 4: Run All Cells**

```
Runtime → Run all (Ctrl+F9)
```

**Execution flow:**
1. ✅ Mount Google Drive
2. ✅ Load API keys
3. ✅ Install dependencies
4. ✅ Read `pending_actions.json` (7 tasks)
5. ✅ Initialize Executive Team (3 agents)
6. ✅ Execute Task 1 (HIGH): Adapt attention_analysis.py
7. ✅ Execute Task 2 (HIGH): Set up CLIP environment
8. ✅ Execute Task 3 (HIGH): Design statistical framework
9. ✅ Execute Task 4 (HIGH): Run CLIP diagnostic
10. ✅ Execute Task 5-7 (MEDIUM): As time allows
11. ✅ Generate progress report
12. ✅ Save to `execution_progress_update.md`
13. ✅ Create trigger for next Planning Team meeting

### **Step 5: Manual Checkpoint Review**

**After Colab execution completes:**

1. **Read progress report:**
   ```
   reports/handoff/execution_progress_update.md
   ```

2. **Check completion status:**
   - How many HIGH tasks completed?
   - Any tasks failed?
   - Outputs generated?

3. **Verify results:**
   - MLflow run_ids logged?
   - Files created in correct locations?
   - Evidence paths valid?

4. **Decision:**
   - ✅ Approve → Continue to Planning Team meeting
   - ⏸️ Pause → Fix blockers first
   - ❌ Reject → Re-execute failed tasks

### **Step 6: Next Planning Team Meeting**

**If approved:**

Run Planning Team to review results and plan Cycle 2:

```bash
cd multi-agent
python scripts/run_planning_meeting.py
```

**Planning Team will:**
1. Review `execution_progress_update.md`
2. Assess progress toward Week 1 GO/NO-GO
3. Identify next priorities
4. Generate new `pending_actions.json` for Cycle 2

### **Step 7: Repeat Cycle**

Go back to Step 2 and run Colab notebook again with new `pending_actions.json`.

Week 1: Oct 14-20 (Goal: GO/NO-GO Decision)

CYCLE 1 (Oct 14-15)
├─ Planning Team generates pending_actions.json (Tasks 1-2)

- [ ] ≥3 models tested (CLIP, ALIGN, +1)
- [ ] ≥2 models show attention collapse (p<0.05)
- [ ] Statistical validation complete
- [ ] MLflow tracking for all experiments
- [ ] GO/NO-GO decision made

**Decision Thresholds:**

| Outcome | Condition | Paper Scope | Acceptance |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **GO** | ≥2 models with >80% imbalance | Field-wide paper | 72% |
| **PIVOT** | Only V2 shows collapse | Focused case study | 65% |
| **DIAGNOSTIC** | Tools work on all models | Framework contribution | 85% ⭐ |

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

### **Task Execution Rules**

✅ **DO:**
- Execute tasks in strict priority order (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
- Use real deployment tools (Python, MLflow, GPU)
- Save all outputs with evidence paths
- Log MLflow run_ids for reproducibility
- Sync results to Google Drive
- Report progress clearly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip HIGH priority tasks
- Simulate experiments (use real code!)
- Lose track of dependencies
- Forget to log evidence paths
- Miss manual checkpoints

### **Research Philosophy**

❌ **DON'T:** Focus only on fixing our V2 model
✅ **DO:** Investigate if this is a broader phenomenon
✅ **DO:** Create diagnostic tools for any architecture
✅ **DO:** Contribute insights for entire community

### **Evidence Rule**

Every claim must cite: `file_path#run_id#line_number`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Colab GPU not available**

**Solution:**
```
Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU → A100
```

If A100 not available, use T4 or V100 (slower but works).

### **Problem: API keys not loaded**

**Check:**
```
MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/.env file exists
```

**Verify in Colab:**
```python
import os
print(os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'))  # Should not be None
```

### **Problem: pending_actions.json not found**

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run Planning Team meeting first
cd multi-agent
python scripts/run_planning_meeting.py
```

### **Problem: execution_progress_update.md not generated**

**Check:**
1. All Colab cells ran successfully?
2. Google Drive mounted?
3. File permissions OK?

**Manual workaround:**
Check intermediate results in:
```
reports/execution/results/execution_results_*.json
```
