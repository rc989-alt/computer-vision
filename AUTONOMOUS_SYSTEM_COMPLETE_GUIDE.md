## 🎯 System Overview

### What Is This?

An **autonomous multi-agent coordination system** that:
- Holds strategic planning meetings with AI agents
- Makes deployment decisions based on consensus
- Executes plans with real tools (deploy, evaluate, collect metrics)
- Runs 24/7 with minimal human intervention
- Progressively deploys V1.0 multimodal model through stages

### Key Features

✅ **Two-Tier Architecture**: Planning Team (advisors) + Executive Team (workers)
✅ **Real Tool Execution**: Deploy models, run evaluations, collect metrics
✅ **Autonomous Operation**: Runs continuously without manual intervention
✅ **Complete Feedback Loop**: Execution results feed back to planning
✅ **Trajectory Preservation**: All meeting history saved with crash recovery
✅ **Priority-Based Execution**: Actions grouped by HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priorities
✅ **Adaptive Timing**: Adjusts meeting frequency based on workload

## 🔄 Workflow

### Complete Cycle (60 minutes)

#### **Minute 0: First Planning Meeting**
```
📊 Planning Team convenes
├─ Reviews project status
├─ Analyzes available data
├─ Discusses deployment strategy
├─ Creates 15-20 action items with priorities
└─ Outputs to reports/planning/ and reports/handoff/
```

#### **Minutes 0-30: Executive Execution Phase 1**
```
⚙️ Executive Team (every 5 min heartbeat)
├─ Cycle 1 (min 0): Execute actions 1-3 (HIGH priority)
├─ Cycle 2 (min 5): Execute actions 4-6 (HIGH priority)
├─ Cycle 3 (min 10): Execute actions 7-9 (MEDIUM priority)
├─ Cycle 4 (min 15): Execute actions 10-12 (MEDIUM priority)
├─ Cycle 5 (min 20): Execute actions 13-15 (LOW priority)
└─ Cycle 6 (min 25): Execute remaining actions (LOW priority)

Tools Used:
• deploy_model(v1_production.pth, stage='shadow')
• run_evaluation(model, validation_set)
• collect_metrics(runs/report/metrics.json)
• run_python_script(research/evaluate_model.py)
```

#### **Minute 30: Second Planning Meeting (With Feedback!)**
```
📊 Planning Team reconvenes
├─ READS execution results from minutes 0-30
├─ Sees what tools succeeded/failed
├─ Analyzes collected metrics
├─ Adjusts deployment strategy
├─ Creates new action items
└─ Outputs updated plan
```

#### **Minutes 30-60: Executive Execution Phase 2**
```
⚙️ Executive Team continues
├─ Executes adjusted plan from planning meeting
├─ More metrics collected
├─ Deployment progresses (shadow → 5% → 20%)
└─ Results saved for next planning meeting
```

#### **Minute 60: Third Planning Meeting (Full Loop)**
```
📊 Planning Team reviews full cycle
├─ Complete feedback: planning → execution → results → planning
├─ V1 deployment progress assessed
├─ V2 research priorities adjusted based on V1 learnings
├─ Next 60-minute cycle planned
└─ System continues autonomously 24/7
```

## 👁️ Monitoring

### Quick Status Check

Run anytime to see system health:

```python
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

print(f"🕐 {datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')}")
print("="*60)

# Meetings completed
result = subprocess.run(['grep', '-c', 'Meeting complete', '/content/executive.log'],
                       capture_output=True, text=True)
print(f"📋 Meetings: {result.stdout.strip()}")

# Tools executed
result2 = subprocess.run(['grep', '-c', 'TOOL.*✅', '/content/executive.log'],
                        capture_output=True, text=True)
print(f"🔧 Tools: {result2.stdout.strip()} successful")

# Check files
import os
files = [
    '/content/cv_project/research/v1_production.pth',
    '/content/cv_project/runs/report/metrics.json',
    '/content/cv_project/data/validation_set/dataset_info.json'
]
all_present = all(os.path.exists(f) for f in files)
print(f"📦 Essential files: {'✅ Present' if all_present else '❌ Missing'}")

# Recent activity
print("\n📜 Last 10 lines:")
log = subprocess.run(['tail', '-10', '/content/executive.log'],
                    capture_output=True, text=True)
print(log.stdout)
```

### What Success Looks Like

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Files Not Found

**Symptom:**
```
[TOOL] File check: research/v1_production.pth -> NOT FOUND
[TOOL] Metrics file not found: runs/report/metrics.json
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Verify files synced
!ls -lh /content/cv_project/research/v1_production.pth
!ls -lh /content/cv_project/runs/report/metrics.json

# If missing, re-run sync
exec(open('/content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/research/colab/sync_all_files.py').read())
```

### Issue: Meeting Hangs

**Symptom:**
```
🎯 Initiating Planning Team Meeting...
[No progress for > 5 minutes]
```

**Solution:**
- Wait 5 minutes (might be API rate limit)
- Check logs: `!tail -50 /content/executive.log`
- System will retry automatically
- If persistent, check API keys loaded: `!grep API /content/executive.log`

### Issue: No Execution After Meeting

**Symptom:**
```
✅ Meeting complete!
[No [TOOL] logs appear in next 10 minutes]
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Check handoff file exists
!cat /content/cv_project/multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json

# Check if Executive Team initialized
!grep "Executive Team" /content/executive.log

# Verify tools available
!grep "ExecutionTools" /content/executive.log
```

### Issue: Colab Disconnected

**Symptom:** Session timeout, notebook disconnected

**Solution:**
All data is safe! Using trajectory preservation:

1. Reconnect to session
2. Check Drive for saved reports:
   ```python
   !ls -lt /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/multi-agent/reports/
   ```
3. Check trajectory log:
   ```python
   !ls /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/sessions/session_*/trajectories/
   ```
4. Re-run deployment script to continue from last state
