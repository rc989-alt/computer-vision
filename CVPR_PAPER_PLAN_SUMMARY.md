## 🎯 Recommended Paper Topic

### Title
**"Modality-Balanced Learning: Preventing Attention Collapse in Multimodal Fusion Networks"**

### Core Contribution
1. **Problem:** Multimodal networks suffer from attention collapse (one modality dominates)
2. **Diagnosis:** Systematic framework using ablation + attention analysis + gradient flow
3. **Solutions:** Modality-Balanced Loss + Progressive Fusion + Adversarial Fusion
4. **Validation:** Real production system showing improvement from 0.15% → 12-20% visual contribution

### Why This Works
- ✅ **We have the problem:** V2 shows clear attention collapse (0.15% visual contribution)
- ✅ **We have the tools:** Attention analysis framework already built (`attention_analysis.py`)
- ✅ **We have solutions:** Modality-Balanced Loss, Progressive Fusion are implementable
- ✅ **We have time:** 24-31 days is tight but achievable
- ✅ **It's novel:** Systematic diagnosis + mitigation is under-explored in CVPR literature
- ✅ **It's practical:** Real production system, not toy benchmarks

   - Run `attention_analysis.py` on current V2 model
   - Document visual contribution: 0.15%
   - Generate attention heatmaps
   - **Owner:** Tech Analysis Team

2. **Modality-Balanced Loss** (Days 3-5)
   - Implement: `L_total = L_task + λ_visual * (-log(visual_attention))`
   - Train 20 epochs (quick validation)
   - Train 50 epochs (full results)
   - **Owner:** Tech Analysis Team

3. **Progressive Fusion** (Days 6-10)
   - Implement layer-by-layer fusion architecture
   - Train 20 epochs (quick validation)
   - Train 50 epochs (full results)
   - **Owner:** Tech Analysis + Pre-Architect

4. **Ablation Studies** (Days 11-15)
   - Test λ_visual = {0.1, 0.3, 0.5}
   - Test fusion depth = {2, 4, 6} layers
   - **Owner:** Tech Analysis + Data Analyst

   - Effect size calculation (Cohen's d)
   - **Owner:** Data Analyst

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)

6. **Adversarial Fusion** (If time permits)
7. **Additional baselines** (CLIP-based fusion)
8. **Latency analysis** (Performance vs. speed tradeoff)

## 🎯 Innovation Angle

### What Makes This Novel for CVPR?

1. **Systematic Diagnostic Framework**
   - Not just "our model is better"
   - Comprehensive diagnosis: ablation + attention + gradients
   - Reproducible methodology

2. **Real Production System**
   - Not ImageNet or COCO benchmarks
   - Real user data and production constraints
   - Practical solutions that scale

3. **Multiple Mitigation Strategies**
   - Comparative analysis of different approaches
   - Guidance on when to use which strategy
   - Ablation studies showing component contributions

4. **Open-Source Tools**
   - Release `attention_analysis.py`
   - Reproducible experiments with MLflow tracking
   - Community can use our diagnostic framework

### Positioning vs. State-of-the-Art

**Existing Work:**
- CLIP, ALIGN: Train from scratch on billions of images (we can't match scale)
- BLIP-2: Q-Former for vision-language alignment (different architecture)
- Flamingo: Few-shot multimodal learning (different problem)

**Our Gap/Contribution:**
- **Diagnosis-first:** Identify WHY multimodal models fail before proposing solutions
- **Practical:** Work with existing architectures, not requiring retraining from scratch
- **Validation:** Real production system, not just benchmarks

**Action if NO-GO:** Consider **workshop paper** instead of main conference

### Week 3 End (Nov 3): Final Checkpoint
**GO if:**

## 🚫 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|

## 📚 Backup Plans

### Backup Option 1: Lightweight Multimodal Fusion
- Focus on CoTRR lightweight approach
- Efficiency vs. accuracy tradeoff
- Deployment-focused angle
