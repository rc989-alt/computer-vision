### Update 1: Fix Ops Commander Model Specification ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Current (Line 97):**
```markdown
Ops Commander (Claude Sonnet 4)
```

**Chinese PDF says:**
```markdown
Ops Commander: Claude Opus 4
```

**Recommendation:**
```markdown
Ops Commander (Claude Opus 4) - V1 Executive Lead
├── Infra Guardian (GPT-4 Turbo)
├── Latency Analyst (Claude Sonnet 4)
├── Compliance Monitor (GPT-4 Turbo)
├── Integration Engineer (Claude Sonnet 4)
└── Rollback Officer (GPT-4 Turbo)
```

**Reason:** The Ops Commander needs the most powerful model (Opus 4) for final decision-making authority.

### Update 2: Add Execution Cycle Detail

**Add new section after "Heartbeat Cycle" (after line 188):**

```markdown

## Execution Team Workflow

### 5-Minute Heartbeat Cycles

During each 30-minute planning interval, the Executive Team runs 6 execution cycles:

**Complete Cycle (Minutes 0-30):**
```
Minute 0: Planning Meeting Complete
         ↓ Generate 15-20 action items
         ↓ Write to pending_actions.json

Minute 0-5: Execution Cycle 1
         → Execute tasks 1-3 (HIGH priority)
         → Tools: deploy_model(), run_evaluation()

Minute 5-10: Execution Cycle 2
         → Execute tasks 4-6 (HIGH priority)
         → Tools: collect_metrics(), run_script()

Minute 10-15: Execution Cycle 3
         → Execute tasks 7-9 (MEDIUM priority)
         → Tools: integration_test(), check_slo()

Minute 15-20: Execution Cycle 4
         → Execute tasks 10-12 (MEDIUM priority)
         → Tools: monitor_latency(), verify_compliance()

Minute 20-25: Execution Cycle 5
         → Execute tasks 13-15 (LOW priority)
         → Tools: generate_report(), backup_state()

Minute 25-30: Execution Cycle 6
         → Execute remaining tasks (LOW priority)
         → Prepare results for next planning meeting

Minute 30: Next Planning Meeting
         ↓ Review execution results
         ↓ Adjust strategy based on outcomes
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Top 3 priority tasks per cycle**: Ensures focused execution
- **30-minute feedback loop**: Results feed back to next planning meeting
- **Continuous execution**: System never idle, always making progress
- **Priority-driven**: HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW order enforced
```

### Update 3: Add Actions.json Example

**Add new section after "Automatic Triggers" (after line 233):**

```markdown
---

## Handoff Mechanism

### Actions JSON Format

The Planning Team creates `pending_actions.json` with complete task specifications:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T20:00:00",
  "meeting_id": "meeting_20251013_200000",
  "actions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "action": "Deploy V1.0 to shadow environment",
      "owner": "ops_commander",
      "priority": "high",
      "estimated_duration": "5min",
      "success_criteria": "Model deployed, no errors, smoke tests pass"
    },
    {

      "action": "Collect baseline metrics",
      "owner": "compliance_monitor",
      "priority": "medium",
      "estimated_duration": "2min",
      "success_criteria": "All SLOs measured and logged"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "action": "Setup rollback procedure",
      "owner": "rollback_officer",
      "priority": "medium",
      "estimated_duration": "3min",
      "success_criteria": "RTO < 10min verified"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "action": "Generate deployment report",
      "owner": "integration_engineer",
      "priority": "low",
      "estimated_duration": "1min",
      "success_criteria": "Report includes all metrics"
    }
  ],
  "count": 5,
  "source": "planning_meeting_2"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

**Required Fields:**
- `id`: Sequential task identifier
- `action`: **Complete description** (not a fragment!) - Must be executable
- `owner`: Which Executive Team agent executes (ops_commander, latency_analyst, etc.)
- `priority`: `high`, `medium`, or `low` - Determines execution order
- `estimated_duration`: Time estimate (e.g., "5min", "10min")
- `success_criteria`: How to verify task completion

**Handoff Directory:**

- **Execution order:** HIGH priority first, then MEDIUM, then LOW

---

### Priority-Based Execution

Executive Team executes actions in strict priority order:

1. **HIGH Priority** (Cycles 1-2): Critical deployment and validation tasks
2. **MEDIUM Priority** (Cycles 3-4): Important monitoring and verification tasks
3. **LOW Priority** (Cycles 5-6): Optional reporting and cleanup tasks

**Example Execution Flow:**

```
Cycle 1 (0 min):  Task 1 (HIGH) → Deploy to shadow
Cycle 1 (1 min):  Task 2 (HIGH) → Evaluate on validation set
Cycle 1 (4 min):  ✅ Cycle 1 complete

Cycle 2 (5 min):  No more HIGH priority tasks
                  → Move to MEDIUM priority

Cycle 2 (5 min):  Task 3 (MEDIUM) → Collect metrics
Cycle 2 (7 min):  Task 4 (MEDIUM) → Setup rollback
Cycle 2 (10 min): ✅ Cycle 2 complete

Cycle 3 (10 min): No more MEDIUM priority tasks
                  → Move to LOW priority

Cycle 3 (10 min): Task 5 (LOW) → Generate report
Cycle 3 (11 min): ✅ All tasks complete

Cycles 4-6:       Idle (all tasks finished early)
```
```

```

#### Minute 30: Second Planning Meeting (With Feedback!)

**Planning Team Reconvenes with Execution Results:**

```
🎯 Meeting Start: 12:30 PM
📊 Participants: Same 6 agents

CRITICAL: This meeting has execution results to review!

Discussion Topics:
- READ execution results from minutes 0-30
- ANALYZE tool execution success/failure (18/18 succeeded)
- REVIEW collected metrics from deployment/shadow/
- CHECK SLO compliance (all green ✅)
- DECIDE: Continue to 5% rollout OR pause for investigation

Meeting Output:
✅ Reviewed 18 execution results
✅ All smoke tests passed
✅ SLO compliance: 100%
✅ DECISION: GO for 5% rollout
✅ New action plan: 15 tasks for next 30 minutes
✅ Updated handoff: pending_actions.json

Meeting Duration: 5.1 minutes
Meeting End: 12:35 PM
```

#### Minutes 30-60: Executive Execution Phase 2

**Executive Team Continues with Adjusted Plan:**

```
⚙️ Cycles 7-12 (12:35 PM - 1:00 PM):
   Same pattern as Cycles 1-6, but executing new tasks:
   - Deploy to 5% traffic
   - Monitor 5% deployment
   - Compare shadow vs 5% metrics
   - Prepare for 20% if successful
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update rollback procedures

Total tools executed: 15
Results saved for next planning meeting (1:00 PM)
```

#### Minute 60: Third Planning Meeting (Full Feedback Loop)

**Planning Team Reviews Complete Cycle:**

```
🎯 Meeting Start: 1:00 PM

CRITICAL: This meeting completes the feedback loop!

Review:
- Planning (0 min) → Execution (0-30 min) → Review (30 min) → Execution (30-60 min) → Review (60 min)
- Full cycle complete: Planning → Execution → Results → Planning

Discussion:
- V1 deployment progress: Shadow ✅, 5% ✅
- Performance: All SLOs met for 1 hour
- Decision: Continue to 20% rollout next week

Next Actions:
- Monitor 5% for 48 hours
- Collect user feedback
- Prepare 20% rollout plan
- System continues 24/7 autonomously

Meeting End: 1:05 PM
Next meeting: 1:30 PM (continue 60-minute cycles forever)
```

### Key Observations

**What Makes This Work:**

1. **Closed Feedback Loop:** Every planning meeting reviews previous execution results
2. **High-Frequency Execution:** 6 cycles × 5 min = continuous progress monitoring
3. **Priority-Driven:** Critical tasks (deployment, validation) execute first
4. **Autonomous Operation:** No manual intervention required
5. **Complete History:** All transcripts, actions, and results preserved

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 18/18 tasks executed successfully in first 30 minutes
- ✅ 15/15 tasks executed successfully in second 30 minutes
- ✅ 100% SLO compliance maintained
- ✅ Feedback loop: Planning → Execution → Results → Planning
- ✅ System adapts strategy based on outcomes

**This is the power of the autonomous system:** It plans, executes, observes results, and adjusts strategy automatically, 24/7, without human intervention.

### Update 5: Add System Comparison Note

**Add new section at the end of the document (after line 676):**

```markdown
---

## System Variants

This guide describes the **two-tier production deployment system** (Planning Team + Executive Team). There is also a **unified research system** variant.

### Two-Tier System (This Guide)

**Purpose:** Production deployment with continuous monitoring
**Architecture:** Planning Team (6 agents) + Executive Team (6 agents)
**Frequency:** Planning every 30 minutes, Execution every 5 minutes
**Focus:** V1 deployment, SLO monitoring, gradual rollout
**Best for:** Production operations, deployment management, infrastructure monitoring

### Unified System (Research Variant)

**Purpose:** Research execution with tight deadlines
**Architecture:** Single unified team (5 agents, 2 with execution tools)
**Frequency:** Meetings every 120 minutes
**Focus:** CVPR research, Safety Gates, MLflow tracking, paper writing
**Best for:** Research projects, experimental validation, academic deadlines

**Files:**
- Production system: `multi-agent/autonomous_coordinator.py`
- Research system: `unified-team/unified_autonomous_system.ipynb`

### When to Use Which

**Use Two-Tier (This System) When:**
- Deploying models to production (shadow → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100%)
- Need continuous monitoring (every 5 minutes)
- High-frequency execution critical (15-20 tasks per 30 minutes)
- Clear planning/execution separation needed
- SLO compliance and rollback procedures required

**Use Unified System When:**
- Research execution with paper deadlines
- Quantitative validation with Safety Gates
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Lower-frequency strategic work (meetings every 2 hours)
- Cost optimization critical (95% cheaper than two-tier)

**Recommendation:** Both systems can coexist. Use two-tier for production deployment, unified for research projects.
