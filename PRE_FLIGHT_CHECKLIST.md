```python
✅ Agents discuss CVPR paper angles
✅ ActionParser extracts actions from responses
✅ Actions stored in self.last_actions
✅ Handoff file created: multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json
```

**Step 2: Executive Execution** (lines 464-649)
```python
✅ Reads self.last_actions
✅ Routes top 3 actions to appropriate agents
✅ Agent responds with execution plan
✅ Tools auto-execute based on response patterns
```

**Step 3: Report Generation**
```python
✅ Execution logs saved to multi-agent/reports/execution/

## ✅ 8. EXECUTION → PLANNING FEEDBACK LOOP

### Continuous Improvement Cycle

**Verified Feedback Mechanism:**

**Phase 1: Execution Summary** (lines 296-330)
```python
✅ _get_execution_summary() reads latest execution reports
✅ Extracts: tool calls, status, outcomes
✅ Formats summary for planning team
```

**Phase 2: Include in Meeting Topic** (line 338)
```python
✅ execution_summary = self._get_execution_summary()
✅ Passed to planning meeting in topic string
✅ Planning team sees results from previous cycle
```

**Phase 3: Planning Team Reviews**
```python
✅ Meeting topic includes: "Execution Results from Previous Cycle"
✅ Shows: Report name, tools executed, status
✅ Planning agents can adjust strategy based on results
```

**Example Feedback Loop:**
```
Cycle 1: Planning creates actions → Executive executes → Generates report
Cycle 2: Planning sees Cycle 1 results → Adjusts strategy → Creates new actions
Cycle 3: Planning sees Cycle 2 results → Continues iteration
```

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED - Feedback loop operational**
