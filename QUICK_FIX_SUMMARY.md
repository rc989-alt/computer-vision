# 🔧 Import Issue - Quick Fix Summary

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Ready to run!

---

## What Was Wrong

```
❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'run_meeting'
```

The sync script was missing **6 critical files** that `executive_coordinator.py` needs to import.

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. Updated `sync_all_files.py`

**Added 6 missing files:**
- ✅ `multi-agent/run_meeting.py` - Meeting orchestrator
- ✅ `multi-agent/agents/roles.py` - Agent definitions
- ✅ `multi-agent/agents/router.py` - Message routing
- ✅ `multi-agent/tools/collect_artifacts.py` - Artifact collection
- ✅ `multi-agent/tools/io_utils.py` - I/O utilities
- ✅ `multi-agent/tools/progress_sync_hook.py` - Progress tracking

**Before:** 37 files synced
**After:** 43 files synced ✨

### 2. Updated `executive_system_improved.ipynb`

**Added automatic path setup + import verification in Step 3:**
- Sets `sys.path` before importing
- Verifies `run_meeting.py` exists
- Tests import before deployment
- Shows clear error if anything fails

## How To Test

1. **Open:** `research/colab/executive_system_improved.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. **Run Step 1:** Should see "✅ Successfully synced: **43 files**"
3. **Run Step 2:** Creates V1 artifacts
4. **Run Step 3:** Should see:
   ```
   ✅ run_meeting.py found
   ✅ Import test successful
   ✅ Planning team initialized (6 agents)
   ✅ Executive team initialized (6 agents)
   🚀 Autonomous system started!
   ```

## Files Modified

| File | What Changed |
|------|-------------|

## Success Indicators

**You'll know it worked when you see:**
- ✅ 43 files synced (not 37)
- ✅ "run_meeting.py found"
- ✅ "Import test successful"
- ✅ Both teams initialized
- ✅ "Autonomous system started!"

**Ready to run!** 🚀
