# How to Update Colab Notebook

**File:** `unified_autonomous_system.ipynb`
**Location:** Google Drive - `unified-team/`
**Purpose:** Add verification and topic generation cells

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Instructions

### Step 1: Open the File
1. Go to: `/Users/guyan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-.../unified-team/`
2. Open: `COLAB_NEW_CELLS.txt`
3. This file contains all 4 new cells to add

### Step 2: Open Colab Notebook
1. Go to Google Colab
2. Open `unified_autonomous_system.ipynb`
3. Find Cell #18 ("View Latest Results")

### Step 3: Add 4 New Cells
Copy-paste from `COLAB_NEW_CELLS.txt`:

**NEW CELL 1: After-Meeting Verification**
- Markdown header + Code cell
- Checks: Tool usage, executor activity, new artifacts
- Runs: POST_MEETING_EXECUTION_CHECK.py

**NEW CELL 2: Generate Next Meeting Topic**
- Markdown header + Code cell
- Runs: generate_context_rich_topic.py
- Shows preview of generated topic

**NEW CELL 3: Quick Status Dashboard**
- Markdown header + Code cell
- Shows: Meeting stats, tool trends, cost tracking
- Monitors: Task adaptation rate

**NEW CELL 4: Emergency Troubleshooting**
- Markdown header + Code cell
- Diagnoses: Why meetings aren't executing
- Provides: Specific fixes

### Step 4: Save

## üìã What Each Cell Does

### Cell 1: Verification (Run after each meeting)
```python
# Quick checks:
- Tools Executed: 5 ‚úÖ EXECUTION
- Research Director: ‚úÖ Used tools
- Tech Analyst: ‚úÖ Used tools
- New artifacts: 3 files found
```

### Cell 2: Topic Generation (Run after verification)
```python
# Generates NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md
- Forces transcript reading
- Uses actions.json only for priorities
- Prevents missing info problem
```

### Cell 3: Dashboard (Run anytime)
```python
# Shows:
- Total meetings: 5
- Tool usage trend: ‚úÖ 4/5 execution meetings
- Cost: $0.45 (avg $0.09/meeting)
- Task adaptation: 75% new tasks
```

### Cell 4: Troubleshooting (Only if problems)
```python
# Diagnoses:
1. Topic forcing transcript reading? ‚úÖ
2. Agents actually reading? ‚úÖ
3. Actions.json broken? 90% ‚ö†Ô∏è (normal - handled)
4. Recommendations: [specific fixes]
```

## üéØ Workflow After Each Meeting

### Automatic (On Colab):
1. Meeting runs every 120 minutes
2. Agents execute tasks
3. Transcript saved to reports/

### Manual (Run these cells):
1. **Run Cell: Step 10 (Verification)**
   - Check if execution happened
   - Expected: Tools > 0, both executors active

2. **Run Cell: Step 11 (Generate Topic)**
   - Create context-rich topic for next meeting
   - Expected: NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md generated

3. **Optional: Run Cell: Step 12 (Dashboard)**
   - See overall progress
   - Check adaptation rate

4. **Only if needed: Run Cell: Step 13 (Troubleshooting)**
   - If meetings not executing
   - Follow recommendations

## üîç Quick Verification Workflow

**After first execution meeting (~2:30 PM):**

```python
# In Colab, run these cells in order:

# 1. Verification
# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ EXECUTION MEETING CONFIRMED
# Tools executed: 5
# Executors active: Research Director, Tech Analyst

# 2. Generate Topic
# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ Generated: unified-team/NEXT_MEETING_TOPIC.md
# Based on meeting: 20251014_143052
# Tasks adapt to meeting results

# 3. Dashboard
# Expected output:
# Total meetings: 2
# Last 5: PLANNING, EXECUTION ‚úÖ
# Task adaptation: 80% new tasks ‚úÖ
```

## ‚úÖ You're Ready!

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ System running on Colab
- ‚úÖ Context-rich topic generated
- ‚úÖ Verification scripts ready
- ‚úÖ Instructions complete

**Next Steps:**
1. Open `COLAB_NEW_CELLS.txt` on Google Drive
