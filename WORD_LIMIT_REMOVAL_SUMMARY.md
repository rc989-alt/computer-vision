# Word Limit Removal - Planning Team Prompts

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Issue:** Agent summaries were truncated, preventing full visibility into Planning Team analysis

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem

User reported: "remove order in all summary: '(â‰¤ 250 words)' as i cannnot get access to the full summary"

**Root Cause:** Planning Team agent prompt files contained word limit instructions like:
- `(â‰¤ 250 words)`
- `(â‰¤ 300 words)`
- `(â‰¤ 200 words)`
- `(â‰¤ 100 words)`
- `(â‰¤ 50 words)`
- `(â‰¤ 30 words)`

These limits were causing agents to truncate their responses, preventing the user from seeing complete analysis, especially when reviewing execution results and planning next cycles.

## âœ… Solution

Removed all word limit instructions from the 4 main Planning Team prompt files:

### **Files Modified:**

#### 1. `01_strategic_leader.md` (3 changes)
- **Line 199:** `### MEETING SYNTHESIS (â‰¤ 250 words)` â†’ `### MEETING SYNTHESIS`
- **Line 202:** `### ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (â‰¤ 180 words)` â†’ `### ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW`
- **Line 218:** `### RESEARCH STATUS UPDATE (â‰¤ 200 words)` â†’ `### RESEARCH STATUS UPDATE`

#### 2. `02_empirical_validation_lead.md` (2 changes)
- **Line 203:** `### DATA INTEGRITY ANALYSIS (â‰¤ 300 words)` â†’ `### DATA INTEGRITY ANALYSIS`
- **Line 206:** `### TECHNICAL SUMMARY (â‰¤ 200 words)` â†’ `### TECHNICAL SUMMARY`

#### 3. `03_critical_evaluator_openai.md` (3 changes)
- **Line 100:** `### CRITIC SUMMARY (â‰¤ 250 words)` â†’ `### CRITIC SUMMARY`
- **Line 125:** `**Rationale:** (â‰¤ 50 words)` â†’ `**Rationale:** Breakdown of deductions`
- **Line 129:** `**Rationale (â‰¤ 30 words)**` â†’ `**Rationale:**`

#### 4. `04_gemini_research_advisor.md` (1 change)
- **Line 55:** `**SYNTHESIS SUMMARY (â‰¤ 100 words):**` â†’ `**SYNTHESIS SUMMARY:**`

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

**For the next Planning Team review meeting (Cycle 3):**

1. Open `planning_team_review_cycle.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Planning Team agents will now provide **full, untruncated responses**
4. You'll see complete analysis of:
   - Meeting synthesis (Strategic Leader)
   - Data integrity findings (Empirical Validation Lead)
   - Critical evaluation (Critical Evaluator)
   - Research insights (Gemini Research Advisor)

---

## ðŸ“Š Impact

**Before:** Agents limited to 30-300 words per section â†’ truncated analysis
**After:** Agents provide complete analysis â†’ full visibility into reasoning

**This is especially important for:**
- Reviewing detailed execution results from Cycle 2 (8 tasks completed)
- Planning complex next steps (BLIP/Flamingo diagnostics, cross-model comparison)
- Understanding statistical findings and experimental recommendations
- Making informed GO/NO-GO decisions for Week 1

---

## âœ… Verification

You can verify the changes by checking that none of the prompt files contain these patterns anymore:
```bash
grep -E "â‰¤.*words|word limit|maximum.*words" agents/prompts/planning_team/*.md
```

**Expected result:** No matches (all word limits removed)

---

## ðŸš€ Ready for Cycle 3 Planning Review!

The Planning Team is now configured to provide complete, detailed analysis without artificial truncation limits. When you run the next planning meeting, you'll get full visibility into:

- âœ… Complete meeting synthesis
- âœ… Full data integrity analysis
- âœ… Detailed critical evaluation
- âœ… Comprehensive research insights
- âœ… Complete statistical reasoning
- âœ… Full experimental recommendations

**Run `planning_team_review_cycle.ipynb` in Colab to start the Cycle 3 planning review!**
