## Planning → Executive Handoff (Detailed Analysis)

### Phase 1: Planning Meeting

**Location:** `executive_coordinator.py` lines 332-462

**What happens:**
1. Meeting orchestrator runs planning meeting with 6 agents
2. Agents discuss CVPR paper topic
3. **ActionParser** extracts actions from agent responses
4. Actions stored in `self.last_actions` (line 424)
5. Handoff file created: `multi-agent/reports/handoff/pending_actions.json` (line 443)

**Code:**
```python
# Store actions for execution
if 'actions' in result and result['actions']:
    self.last_actions = result['actions']  # Line 424
    self._log(f"   📋 Stored {len(self.last_actions)} actions for execution")

# Create handoff file for executive team
handoff_file = handoff_dir / "pending_actions.json"
json.dump({
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "actions": actions_data,
    "count": len(actions_data)
}, f, indent=2)
```

**✅ This works correctly!**

### Phase 2: Action Extraction

**Location:** `multi-agent/tools/parse_actions.py`

**How it works:**
```python
action_patterns = {
    'code_change': r'(?:implement|code|write|modify|update|refactor)\s+([^.!?\n]+)',
    'experiment': r'(?:test|experiment|try|validate|measure)\s+([^.!?\n]+)',
    'analysis': r'(?:analyze|investigate|examine|study|review)\s+([^.!?\n]+)',
    'decision': r'(?:decide|choose|select|recommend)\s+([^.!?\n]+)'
}
```

**Example:**
- Agent says: "**Implement** Modality-Balanced Loss training"
- Parser extracts: `Action(action_type='code_change', description='Modality-Balanced Loss training', agent='tech_analysis', priority='medium')`

**✅ This works correctly!**

### Phase 3: Executive Execution

**Location:** `executive_coordinator.py` lines 464-488

**Execution flow:**
1. System enters Phase 3 after planning meeting
2. Checks if `self.last_actions` exists (line 265)
3. Calls `_execute_actions(self.last_actions)` (line 267)
4. For each action (top 3):
   - Extract action text (lines 482-494)
   - Match keywords to route to appropriate agent (lines 496-501)
   - Agent responds with execution plan (line 547)
   - If tools mentioned, execute them (lines 551-556)

**✅ Now works with research keywords!**

---

## Action Routing Analysis

### Before Fix (Lines 469-476):

```python
action_routing = {
    "deploy": "ops_commander",
    "monitor": "infra_guardian",
    "optimize": "latency_analyst",
    "validate": "compliance_monitor",
    "integrate": "integration_engineer",
    "rollback": "rollback_officer"
}
```

**Problem:** Most CVPR research actions don't contain these keywords.

**Result:** All actions default to ops_commander (line 503).

### After Fix (Lines 469-527):

```python
action_routing = {
    # Deployment keywords
    "deploy": "ops_commander",
    "deployment": "ops_commander",
    "rollback": "rollback_officer",

    # Research execution keywords (NEW!)
    "experiment": "integration_engineer",
    "implement": "integration_engineer",
    "train": "integration_engineer",
    "baseline": "integration_engineer",
    "test": "integration_engineer",
    "run": "integration_engineer",
    "design": "integration_engineer",
    "architecture": "integration_engineer",
    "fusion": "integration_engineer",

    # Research analysis keywords (NEW!)
    "analyze": "latency_analyst",
    "evaluation": "latency_analyst",
    "results": "latency_analyst",
    "metrics": "latency_analyst",
    "optimize": "latency_analyst",

    # Validation keywords (NEW!)
    "validate": "compliance_monitor",
    "statistical": "compliance_monitor",
    "significance": "compliance_monitor",
    "p-value": "compliance_monitor",
    "bootstrap": "compliance_monitor",

    # Literature keywords (NEW!)
    "search": "infra_guardian",
    "paper": "infra_guardian",
    "cvpr": "infra_guardian",
    "survey": "infra_guardian",
}
```

**Result:** Research actions distributed across all 6 executive agents!

### Example CVPR Actions → Routing:

| Action from Planning | Keyword Match | Routed To |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| "Run baseline attention analysis on V2" | run, baseline, analysis | integration_engineer ✅ |
| "Implement Modality-Balanced Loss" | implement | integration_engineer ✅ |
| "Train model with 20 epochs" | train | integration_engineer ✅ |
| "Analyze attention collapse results" | analyze, results | latency_analyst ✅ |
| "Validate statistical significance (p<0.05)" | validate, statistical, p-value | compliance_monitor ✅ |
| "Search recent CVPR papers on fusion" | search, cvpr, paper | infra_guardian ✅ |
| "Design Progressive Fusion architecture" | design, architecture, fusion | integration_engineer ✅ |
| "Evaluate experiment performance" | evaluation, results | latency_analyst ✅ |

**✅ All research actions now route correctly!**

## Executive Team Prompts Analysis

### Current Focus: Production Deployment

**Ops Commander:**
- Focus: Deployment governance, GO/NO-GO decisions, SLO enforcement
- Prompts about: Metrics dashboards, production logs, MLflow tracking
- Output: Deployment status (GO/SHADOW/PAUSE/REJECT)

**Integration Engineer:**
- Focus: API compatibility, schema validation, shadow runs
- Prompts about: Interface compatibility, dependency versions
- Output: Integration risk matrix

**Latency Analyst:**
- Focus: Performance analysis, latency profiling
- Prompts about: P95 latency, throughput, regression detection
- Output: Performance assessment

**Compliance Monitor:**
- Focus: Metrics compliance, SLO validation
- Prompts about: Compliance metrics, error rates
- Output: Compliance status

**Infra Guardian:**
- Focus: Infrastructure monitoring, resource tracking
- Prompts about: System health, resource utilization
- Output: Infrastructure status

**Rollback Officer:**
- Focus: Rollback readiness, recovery procedures
- Prompts about: Rollback conditions, recovery plans
- Output: Rollback assessment

### ⚠️ Mismatch with CVPR Research

**Research needs:**
- Run Python experiments
- Implement new neural architectures
- Train models with different hyperparameters
- Analyze attention mechanisms
- Validate statistical significance
- Search academic literature
- Write paper sections

**Current prompts:**
- Focus on production stability
- Emphasize SLO compliance
- Risk-averse (deployment-focused)
- Quantitative metrics (latency, error rate)

### 🤔 Will This Work?

**Answer: YES, but with caveats**

**Why it will work:**
1. Agents are LLMs - they're flexible and can adapt to new tasks
2. The context passed to agents includes the research action (line 529)
3. Agents can respond with research plans even if prompts are deployment-focused
4. Human review ensures quality

**Example:** Integration Engineer receives:
```
Action: Implement Modality-Balanced Loss training
Priority: HIGH
Assigned Owner: Tech Analysis

Provide your execution plan. If you need to use tools, specify them clearly.
```

Even though Integration Engineer's prompt is about "API compatibility", they can still:
- Understand this is a research task
- Propose implementation steps
- Suggest tools to run (Python script, training command)
- Provide expected outcomes

**The action context overrides the base prompt.**

---

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: Add Research-Specific Guidance (Optional)

**Option A:** Add a section to executive team prompts:

```markdown
## RESEARCH EXECUTION MODE (For CVPR Paper)

When executing research actions (experiments, implementations, analysis):
- Focus on scientific rigor and reproducibility
- Use MLflow tracking for all experiments
- Provide clear commands to execute (Python scripts, training runs)
- Specify expected outputs (metrics, visualizations, artifacts)
- Include statistical validation where appropriate

Example tools:
- `python research/tools/attention_analysis.py` - Analyze attention patterns
- `python research/02_v2_research_line/train_modality_balanced.py` - Train with new loss
- `python research/tools/statistical_validation.py` - Validate significance
```

**Pros:**
- Explicit guidance for research tasks
- Agents know what tools to use
- Better structured responses

**Cons:**
- Requires updating 6 prompt files
- Takes time to implement

**Option B:** Use current prompts as-is

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- No changes needed
- Agents adapt contextually

**Cons:**
- Responses may be less structured
- May need more human review

**Recommendation:** **Option B for now**, then Option A if needed based on results.

### Priority 2: Monitor First Execution Cycle

Watch the first execution phase to see:
- Do executive agents provide useful research execution plans?
- Are tools being called correctly?
- Do responses need more structure?

Based on results, decide if prompt updates are needed.

### Priority 3: Consider Research Executor Agent (Future)

If executive team struggles with research tasks, add a dedicated research executor:

```python
"research_executor": {
    "name": "Research Executor",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "role": "Execute research experiments",
    "prompt_file": "research_executor.md"
}
```

With specialized prompt for CVPR research tasks.
