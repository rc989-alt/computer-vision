## üö´ What We Should NOT Do

### ‚ùå Bad Angle 1: "Novel Architecture from Scratch"
**Why Not:** 24 days is too short to design, implement, train, and validate completely new architecture

### ‚ùå Bad Angle 2: "Beat SOTA on ImageNet"
**Why Not:** Requires massive compute and time we don't have

### ‚ùå Bad Angle 3: "Survey/Analysis Paper"
**Why Not:** CVPR prefers novel methods with strong empirical results

### ‚ùå Bad Angle 4: "V1 vs V2 Comparison"
**Why Not:** Not novel enough for CVPR

---

## ‚úÖ Feasibility Assessment

### Can We Execute This in 24 Days?

**YES, because:**

1. **Problem is defined:** Attention collapse in V2 (0.15% visual contribution)
2. **Tools exist:** attention_analysis.py already built
3. **Solutions are scoped:** Modality-Balanced Loss + Progressive Fusion are implementable
4. **Infrastructure ready:** MLflow tracking, multi-agent system, GPU access
5. **We have data:** Real production dataset

**Risks:**
- Experiments take longer than expected ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Start Week 1 immediately
- Results not strong enough ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Have backup ablations ready
- Writing takes too long ‚Üí **Mitigation:** Start writing early (Week 3)

### Resource Requirements

**Compute:**
- GPU hours: ~200 hours (5 models √ó 50 epochs √ó ~0.8 hours/epoch)
- Can parallelize on Colab Pro+ or cloud GPUs
- **Cost:** ~$100-200 for GPU time

**People:**
- Research Director (new role): Full-time on paper
- Tech Analysis: Experiments (50% time)
- Data Analyst: Statistical validation (25% time)
- Pre-Architect: Architecture design (25% time)

## ü§î Alternative Angles (If Primary Fails)

### Backup Option 1: "Multi-Agent System for Automated ML"
- Focus on the multi-agent system itself
- How planning + execution agents optimize research
- **Risk:** Less traditional CV, might not fit CVPR

### Backup Option 2: "Lightweight Multimodal Fusion for Production"
- Focus on CoTRR lightweight approach
- Efficiency vs. accuracy tradeoff
- **Risk:** Less novel, more incremental

### Backup Option 3: "Safety Gates for Multimodal Deployment"
- Focus on the safety gate validation framework
- How to prevent broken models from reaching production
- **Risk:** More engineering than research

## üéì Recommendation

**PRIMARY STRATEGY:** Go with "Diagnosing and Fixing Attention Collapse in Multimodal Fusion"

**Rationale:**
1. ‚úÖ **We have the problem** (V2 attention collapse)
2. ‚úÖ **We have the tools** (diagnostic framework)
3. ‚úÖ **We have solutions** (Modality-Balanced Loss, Progressive Fusion)
4. ‚úÖ **We have time** (24 days is tight but doable)
5. ‚úÖ **It's novel** (systematic diagnosis + mitigation is under-explored)
6. ‚úÖ **It's practical** (real production system)

**Confidence:** 70% we can produce a solid CVPR submission
**Backup Plan:** If Week 1 results are weak, pivot to Backup Option 2 (Lightweight Fusion)
