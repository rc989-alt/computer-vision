## 🎯 What Will Happen When You Run

### Phase 1: System Initialization (1-2 minutes)

```
🚀 STARTING EXECUTIVE AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM
✅ Initialized deployment state
✅ Planning Team initialized (6 agents) ← NEW: includes Research Director
✅ Executive Team initialized (6 agents)
✅ Execution Tools initialized (with MLflow)
💓 Heartbeat system started
✅ File sync completed (43+ files)
```

### Phase 2: First Planning Meeting (30 minutes)

**Research Director will:**
1. Present CVPR 2025 opportunity (24 days to abstract, 31 days to paper)
2. Analyze current research assets (V1, V2, CoTRR)
3. Propose paper angles:
   - **Primary:** Attention collapse diagnosis + mitigation
   - **Alternatives:** Lightweight fusion, multi-agent ML, safety gates
4. Request team input and discussion

**Other Agents will:**
- **Data Analyst:** Validate V2 attention collapse (0.15% visual contribution)
- **Pre-Architect:** Propose fusion innovations (Modality-Balanced Loss, Progressive Fusion)
- **Tech Analysis:** Assess implementation feasibility (can do in Week 1)
- **Critic:** Check for realistic timeline and novelty
- **Moderator:** Synthesize and create action plan

**Meeting Output:**
```
📊 Meeting complete!
📊 Agents participated: 6
📋 Actions identified: 10-15
🔍 Integrity check: PASS/FAIL
📋 Stored actions for execution
⏱️  Meeting duration: ~30 minutes
```

### Phase 3: Action Execution (Continuous)

**Ops Commander will execute (every 5 minutes):**
```
🎯 Executing 3 priority actions...

🤖 Tech Analysis executing action...
   [TOOL] Starting MLflow run: v2_baseline_attention_analysis
   [TOOL] Running: python3 research/tools/attention_analysis.py
   [TOOL] Exit code: 0
   ✅ Executed 1 tool operations

🤖 Ops Commander executing action...
   [TOOL] Collecting metrics from: runs/report/metrics.json
   [TOOL] ✅ Collected 9 metrics
   [TOOL] Validating safety gates...
   [TOOL] ❌ visual_ablation_drop: 0.15% < 5.0% (FAIL)
   ✅ Safety gate issue detected

✅ Executed 3/3 actions
💾 Execution report saved
```

### Phase 4: Feedback Loop (30-minute cycles)

```
Minute 0-30:   First planning meeting
Minute 30-35:  Execute 3 actions
Minute 35-40:  Execute 3 more actions
Minute 60:     Second planning meeting (reviews first hour results)
...and so on autonomously
```

## 🎯 Expected First Meeting Topics

### Research Director Will Propose

**Primary Angle:**
> "Team, we have 24 days to CVPR abstract. I propose focusing on our V2 attention collapse problem - visual features contribute only 0.15% when they should be 5-20%. This is a clear research problem with practical solutions we can implement."

**Supporting Evidence:**
- V2 model showing attention collapse
- Diagnostic tools already built (attention_analysis.py)
- Solutions defined (Modality-Balanced Loss, Progressive Fusion)
- Real production system for validation

**Week 1 Plan:**
1. Day 1-2: Baseline characterization
2. Day 3-5: Implement Modality-Balanced Loss
3. Day 6-7: Implement Progressive Fusion
4. End of Week 1: GO/NO-GO decision

### Alternative Angles (If Team Suggests)

**Research Director will be open to:**
- Novel lightweight fusion architectures
- Multi-agent systems for automated ML research
- Safety gates and production deployment frameworks
- Other innovative ideas from team discussion

**Decision Criteria:**
- Novel enough for CVPR? (not incremental)
- Achievable in 24 days? (not completely new research)
- Leverages existing assets? (V1, V2, tools)
- Team consensus? (agents agree it's viable)

## 🚨 What to Watch For

### Good Signs ✅

**In Planning Meeting:**
- Research Director proposes clear paper topic
- Team reaches consensus on research direction
- 10-15 specific, actionable items created
- All agents participate (6 planning agents)
- Integrity check passes

**In Execution:**
- MLflow tracking starts successfully
- Tools execute without errors (exit code 0)
- Safety gates are validated
- Results are logged properly

**In Results:**
- Experiments show improvement (0.15% → 5%+)
- Statistical significance achieved (p < 0.05)
- Attention collapse diagnosis confirms problem

### Warning Signs ⚠️

**In Planning Meeting:**
- No consensus on research direction
- Experiments too ambitious for 24-day timeline
- Integrity check fails (low consensus, contradictions)
- Missing MLflow run_ids or evidence requirements

**In Execution:**
- Tools failing (non-zero exit codes)
- GPU disconnected or unavailable
- Drive sync failing
- No experiments being logged

**In Results:**
- No improvement from mitigation strategies
- Results not reproducible
- Statistical tests not significant

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### If Research Director Not Participating

**Check file exists:**
```python
!ls /content/cv_project/multi-agent/agents/prompts/planning_team/research_director.md
```

**If missing, copy from Drive:**
```python
!cp /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/multi-agent/agents/prompts/planning_team/research_director.md \
   /content/cv_project/multi-agent/agents/prompts/planning_team/
```

### If MLflow Not Working

**No problem!** System uses local fallback automatically:
```
⚠️  MLflow not installed - using local tracking
✅ Started local experiment tracking: run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

Results saved to: `multi-agent/experiments/`

### If Experiments Taking Too Long

**Option 1:** Use smaller epochs for quick validation
```python
# In experiment config
num_epochs = 10  # instead of 50
```

**Option 2:** Reduce model size
```python
# Use lightweight variant
hidden_dim = 256  # instead of 512
```

**Option 3:** Parallel GPUs
- Open multiple Colab notebooks
- Run different experiments in parallel

   !ls /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/computer-vision-clean/
   ```

2. **GPU Available**
   ```python
   !nvidia-smi
   ```

3. **API Keys Set**
   ```python
   import os
   print("OPENAI_API_KEY:", "SET" if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") else "MISSING")
   print("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:", "SET" if os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY") else "MISSING")
   ```

4. **Research Director Role Exists**
