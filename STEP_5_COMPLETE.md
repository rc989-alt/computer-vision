## 🏗️ Research Infrastructure Built

### 1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline** (`research/src/feature_extractor.py`)
- **Multi-modal Features**: CLIP embeddings (1024-dim) + Visual attributes (8-dim) + Conflict scores (5-dim)
- **Domain Normalization**: Per-domain z-score normalization to handle domain shift
- **Train/Test Splitting**: Canonical ID-based splitting to prevent leakage
- **Pairwise Training Data**: RankNet-style positive/negative pairs within query groups

### 2. **CoTRR-lite Reranker Architecture** (`research/src/reranker_train.py`)
- **Dual Objective**: λ·Compliance + (1−λ)·(1−p_conflict) with λ=0.7
- **RankNet Loss**: Pairwise ranking optimization for better@worse ordering
- **Ablation Support**: CLIP-only vs +Visual vs +Conflict vs Full configurations
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Production-ready with proper weight initialization

### 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Suite** (`research/src/eval_suite.py`)
- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI with 1000 bootstrap samples
- **Ranking Metrics**: Compliance@1/3/5, nDCG@10, MRR, Precision/Recall@K
- **Conflict Calibration**: AUC, ECE, Brier score for probability quality
- **Failure Analysis**: Systematic error analysis with explanations and fixes

### 4. **Step 4 Integration** (`research/src/generate_training_data.py`)
- **Pipeline Output Loader**: Reads Step 4 manifest and scored JSONL files
- **Feature Enhancement**: Adds calibrated conflicts, quality scores, derived features
- **Versioning**: Links training data to specific Step 4 model/overlay versions
- **Metadata Tracking**: Complete audit trail for reproducibility

### 5. **Research Demo Framework** (`research/step5_integration_demo.py`)
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Data generation → Feature extraction → Training → Evaluation
- **Ablation Automation**: Systematic comparison across feature combinations
- **Report Generation**: JSON reports with detailed metrics and recommendations
- **Production Integration**: Ready for Step 4 A/B testing deployment

## 🔗 Production Integration Points

### **With Step 4 Pipeline**
- ✅ **Data Flow**: Step 4 scored outputs → Research training data
- ✅ **Feature Compatibility**: Same CLIP embeddings, visual attributes, conflict scores
- ✅ **Model Registry**: Integrates with existing A/B testing framework
- ✅ **Monitoring**: SLO thresholds align with Step 4 metrics

### **Deployment Readiness**
- ✅ **Shadow Testing**: Ready for Step 4 shadow deployment
- ✅ **Version Management**: Immutable model artifacts with metadata
- ✅ **Rollback Capability**: Perfect integration with Step 4 rollback system
- ✅ **Monitoring Integration**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

## 💡 Research Improvement Roadmap

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Increase Training Data**: Use multiple Step 4 pipeline runs (target: 5k+ items)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Add temporal features, domain-specific attributes
3. **Architecture Tuning**: Experiment with attention mechanisms, deeper networks
4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Bayesian optimization for learning rate, architecture

### **Advanced Research (Step 6-7)**
1. **Conflict Calibration**: Temperature scaling, Platt scaling for better ECE
2. **Domain Adaptation**: Domain-adversarial training for better generalization
3. **Active Learning**: Identify high-value borderline items for labeling
4. **Multi-task Learning**: Joint optimization of compliance + conflict + quality

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

**With More Data (5k items):**
- Compliance@1: +2-4 additional points (total: +3-5 pts vs baseline)
- nDCG@10: +4-8 additional points (total: +5-9 pts vs baseline)
- Conflict AUC: +0.05-0.10 improvement (target: 0.90+)

**With Better Architecture:**
- Attention mechanisms: +1-2 pts across metrics
- Deeper networks: +0.5-1.5 pts with proper regularization
- Multi-task learning: +1-3 pts via joint optimization

## 🚀 Ready for Production Integration

**Step 4 A/B Testing Integration:**
```python
# Deploy to shadow testing
shadow_deployment = deploy_research_model(
    model_path="research/models/step5_full_reranker/final_model.pt",
    config_path="research/models/step5_full_reranker/config.json",
    environment="shadow"
)

# Monitor performance vs Step 4 dual scoring
monitor_ab_test(
    baseline="step4_dual_scoring",
    candidate="cotrr_lite_reranker",
    metrics=["compliance_at_1", "conflict_rate", "throughput"]
)
```

**Automated Retraining Pipeline:**
```python
# Weekly retraining on fresh Step 4 data
schedule_retraining(
    data_source="runs/latest",
    training_config="research/configs/cotrr_lite.yaml", 
    promotion_criteria={"compliance_improvement": 2.0, "conflict_auc": 0.88}
)
```
