# Upload to Google Drive Checklist

Your Google Drive structure: `MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/` ✅

## What You've Already Uploaded ✅

- ✅ `autonomous_coordinator.py`
- ✅ `autonomous_coordination.yaml`
- ✅ Entire project folder structure

## What You Still Need to Upload

### 1. The .env File (CRITICAL - Required for API keys)

**Source**: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/.env`

**Destination**: Upload to `MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/.env`

**How to upload**:
1. Go to drive.google.com
2. Navigate to `My Drive/cv_multimodal/project/`
3. Click "New" → "File upload"
4. Select `.env` from your laptop at: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/.env`
5. Click "Open" to upload

**Important**: The file is named `.env` (starts with a dot). On Mac, press `Cmd+Shift+.` in file browser to show hidden files.

**Verification**: After upload, you should see `.env` file in `cv_multimodal/project/` folder

### 2. Updated Colab Notebook (CRITICAL - Has the fixes)

**Source**: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`

**Destination**: Upload to `MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`

**How to upload**:
1. Go to drive.google.com
2. Navigate to `My Drive/cv_multimodal/project/research/colab/`
3. Delete the old `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb` if it exists
4. Click "New" → "File upload"
5. Select the notebook from: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`
6. Click "Open" to upload

**Verification**: After upload, right-click the notebook → "Open with" → "Google Colaboratory"

### 3. Multi-agent Tools (Should already be there, verify)

**Check these folders exist** in `MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/multi-agent/`:
- `tools/` folder
- `agents/` folder (with `prompts/` subfolder)

**If missing**, upload from:
- Source: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent/tools/`
- Source: `/Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision/multi-agent/agents/`

## Quick Upload Commands (Alternative Method)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Install rclone (if not already installed)
# brew install rclone

# Configure Google Drive
# rclone config

# Upload files
cd /Users/guyan/computer_vision/computer-vision

# Upload .env
rclone copy .env gdrive:cv_multimodal/project/

# Upload updated notebook
rclone copy research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb gdrive:cv_multimodal/project/research/colab/

# Upload tools (if needed)
rclone copy multi-agent/tools/ gdrive:cv_multimodal/project/multi-agent/tools/ -r
rclone copy multi-agent/agents/ gdrive:cv_multimodal/project/multi-agent/agents/ -r
```

## Verification Checklist

After uploading, verify in Google Drive:

```
MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/
├── .env                                     ✅ Check this exists
├── multi-agent/
│   ├── autonomous_coordinator.py            ✅ Already uploaded
│   ├── configs/
│   │   └── autonomous_coordination.yaml     ✅ Already uploaded
│   ├── tools/                               ❓ Verify exists
│   └── agents/                              ❓ Verify exists
└── research/
    └── colab/
        └── autonomous_system_colab.ipynb    ✅ Upload this (updated version)
```

## After Upload: Run Notebook

1. Go to drive.google.com
2. Navigate to `cv_multimodal/project/research/colab/`
3. Right-click `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`
4. Select "Open with" → "Google Colaboratory"
5. Run cells in order

**Expected output after running setup cell**:
```
🔍 Auto-detecting project location on Google Drive...

📂 Checking common locations:
✅ Found: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project
   Folders: multi-agent, research, docs, data, tools

✅ Found project at: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project
   Contains X Python files in multi-agent/
   ✅ autonomous_coordinator.py found
   ✅ autonomous_coordination.yaml found

📁 Drive project: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project
📁 Local project: /content/cv_project
📁 Results save to: /content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/results
```

## If Auto-Detection Still Fails

The notebook will prompt you. Just enter:
```
/content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project
```

## Priority: Upload These 2 Files First

**Minimum to get started**:
1. `.env` ← API keys (critical)
2. `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb` ← Updated notebook with fixes (critical)

Everything else should already be there from your previous upload.

## File Sizes Reference

- `.env`: ~360 bytes (tiny)
- `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb`: ~32 KB
- `autonomous_coordinator.py`: ~23 KB ✅
- `autonomous_coordination.yaml`: ~34 KB ✅

**Total upload needed**: ~32 KB (less than 1 second)

## Quick Test

After uploading, test in Colab:

```python
# Test cell - run this in Colab
from pathlib import Path

# Check files exist
project = Path("/content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project")
print(f"Project exists: {project.exists()}")
print(f"multi-agent exists: {(project / 'multi-agent').exists()}")
print(f"coordinator.py exists: {(project / 'multi-agent/autonomous_coordinator.py').exists()}")
print(f"config.yaml exists: {(project / 'multi-agent/configs/autonomous_coordination.yaml').exists()}")
print(f".env exists: {(project / '.env').exists()}")
print(f"notebook exists: {(project / 'research/colab/autonomous_system_colab.ipynb').exists()}")

if all([
    project.exists(),
    (project / 'multi-agent').exists(),
    (project / 'multi-agent/autonomous_coordinator.py').exists(),
    (project / 'multi-agent/configs/autonomous_coordination.yaml').exists(),
    (project / '.env').exists(),
]):
    print("\n✅ All required files present! Ready to start.")
else:
    print("\n❌ Some files missing. Check above.")
```

## Summary

**What to do right now**:
1. Upload `.env` to `cv_multimodal/project/`
2. Upload updated `autonomous_system_colab.ipynb` to `cv_multimodal/project/research/colab/`
3. Open the notebook in Colab
4. Run cells - should work now!

**Time needed**: 2 minutes

**File size**: ~32 KB

**Result**: Notebook will auto-detect your project at `/content/drive/MyDrive/cv_multimodal/project/` ✅
